It\\u2019s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator. So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again. And, yes, together we will make America great again. Trump\\u2019s inaugural address, reportedly written by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior advisor Stephen Miller, was criticized as aggressive, but it was largely an effort to explain what he meant by \\u201cMake America Great Again,\\u201d which is (thankfully!) a very aggressive idea. For an example of a passive campaign theme, try \\u201cHope and Change. \\u201d There is nothing more passive than lying around and hoping some Santa Claus politician comes along with a bag of other people\\u2019s money to fix your life.  Trump was also criticized for delivering an inaugural address that sounded too much like his campaign speeches. This was necessary, because the mainstream media didn\\u2019t relay enough of what he said on the stump. They were too busy freaking out over whatever \\u201coutrageous\\u201d thing he said at any given rally.  It was appropriate for Trump to succinctly explain his platform to the widest audience he\\u2019ll ever have, both within and beyond America\\u2019s borders, with no media filter. Until now, most of the media commentary on \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d consisted of whining about how unfair it was to the inexplicably   Barack Obama, mixed with the occasional lefty primal scream about how America was never great to begin with. Perhaps most importantly, Trump used his inaugural to beat down the asinine smear of \\u201cwhite nationalism. \\u201d His talk of national pride has been corrupted to mean unthinking national chauvinism by the Left. \\u201cAmerica first\\u201d is twisted to mean \\u201cscrew everybody but America\\u201d (or, in the hands of the more mendacious critics, \\u201cscrew the Jews. \\u201d) Then it gets twisted even further by welding the unspoken word \\u201cwhite\\u201d onto \\u201cnationalism,\\u201d transforming it into a racist call to arms. The number of actual white nationalists who talk about white nationalism is vastly smaller than the number of liberals who insist that\\u2019s what they hear when Trump talks about \\u201cAmerican pride. \\u201d Maybe it\\u2019s time for liberals to check in with their therapists and have a long talk about why they hear so many racist dog whistles. In his inaugural, Trump could not have been more clear about the inclusiveness of his vision for American pride. \\u201cWhether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots\\u201d is about as clear as it gets.  Of course, the usual   media swamis will declare they\\u2019ve looked inside Trump\\u2019s mind, and he didn\\u2019t really mean that. He just threw those words in because Kellyanne told him he needed a little racism insurance. But everything about that speech, and everything Trump has said about resurgent American pride, and everything said by the people who want to reclaim nationalism from chauvinism, is inclusive. The point is to insist on both national priorities and national responsibilities, for everyone from   citizens at the immigration office to President Trump and his Cabinet.  The woman from Mexico who took her oath of citizenship yesterday is 100% American. The man from Mexico who slipped across the border in a coyote truck yesterday is not. President Trump has a long list of sacred duties to the woman, but not to the man. This is not a complicated idea, or a racist one, or really even a nationalist one. It\\u2019s Civics 101. It\\u2019s also the idea global socialism must strangle, in order to survive. Liberals who rail against \\u201cnationalism\\u201d are primarily interested in creating a world of zero accountability for their maximum leaders. With borders erased, the Ruling Class can hack the electorate to suit its political needs, and their business partners can slash the cost of labor. \\u201cInternationalist\\u201d leaders are accountable to no nation\\u2019s citizens. Trump\\u2019s inaugural address included a bold statement of the opposite principle. America\\u2019s president has neither control, nor responsibility, over the economies of other nations. He is responsible to Americans, from Nebraska to Detroit, as Trump put it. He set a very high bar for himself to clear by pointedly mentioning Detroit.  He also made a promise that no group will be preyed upon for the advantages of another. To be the president of all Americans means he is the sugar daddy of none. No more will the power of government be used to penalize groups the Left hates, and beat them into line with new social orthodoxies. No more will Washington dream up economic plans that benefit some, or even most, while designating certain \\u201cforgotten people\\u201d as lifetime losers who need to shut up and accept their fate.  Trump referred to \\u201cwealth\\u201d several times in his speech. \\u201cWealth\\u201d means more than just money. Wealth benefits all, no matter how loudly socialists may screech about too much of it accruing to the One Percent. Some people got very rich by designing, building, and selling the device you\\u2019re staring at right now. You are wealthier than your grandparents, because you have it. As for a proud America\\u2019s proper relationship with other nations, Trump said: We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. That\\u2019s not chauvinism, or imperialism. That\\u2019s the understanding America was founded upon. When Thomas Jefferson took his turn at the presidential bat, he called for \\u201cpeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none. \\u201d No one interpreted that to mean \\u201cto Hell with the rest of the world. \\u201d Also, not to put too fine a point on it, but just about every other nation on Earth understands the concept of putting its own interests first, and believes it has a moral obligation to do so. The leaders of some other nations are very good at murmuring sweet globalist nothings into the ears of   elites, but what they actually do is ruthlessly pursue their own national interests. The charade is made much easier for them by the universal understanding that America is supposed to be the one country that never gets to look out for itself, that has no moral right to protect its own interests. Those are all much easier promises to make than keep, to be sure, but Trump did make them. It is wise to be skeptical, and hold his feet to the very large fire he built with that inaugural address.\",\n          \"By Brig Asif H. Raja on November 1, 2016 \\nAsif Haroon Raja \\nThe ISI had developed its long arm capability during the tenures of Gen Akhtar Abdur Rehman, Lt Gen Hamid Gul (VT editor) and Lt Gen Javed Nasir as DG ISI. It was owing to this capability of hitting the chosen target outside the frontiers of Pakistan that the ISI earned the reputation of a dreaded outfit and the best in Asia. The long arm began to shrivel when Benazir Bhutto was PM from 1988 to 1990 and Gen Waheed Kakar was COAS and Lt Gen Javed Ashraf Qazi had replaced Gen Javed Nasir. This change in posture was a result of pressure of the US and the West, pressing Pakistan to refrain from meddling in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) and in India, or else it will be declared a terrorist state. Pressure was mounted at the behest of India which had become strategic partner of USA and Israel in 1991/1992 and darling of the West. \\nAfter the occupation of Afghanistan by 1, 50,000 Soviet forces in December 1979, Pakistan under Gen Ziaul Haq had decided to provide refuge to about 5 million Afghan refugees and to support the Afghan Mujahideen in their resistance. The US came forward with a package of $ 3.5 billion in June 1981 after making a measured assessment that Pakistan had the will and capability to fight the proxy war. The offer was accepted only when it was conveyed that the ISI will coordinate and conduct the entire war without the aid of CIA and that the US and others would restrict their support to provision of funds and weapons/equipment only. As a Frontline State, Pakistan suffered a great deal throughout the Afghan war at the hands of KGB-KHAD-RAW-AlZulfiqar nexus and Afghan armed forces, but achieved the miracle by defeating and pushing out Soviet forces in February 1989. After achieving its objective without employing a single soldier, the US abandoned Pakistan as well as the Mujahideen who had sacrificed 1.5 million people and had helped the US in becoming a sole super power. \\nOnce Pakistan fell from the grace of USA and it was put under sanctions on account of its covert nuclear program suspected to be geared towards making an Islamic bomb, it came under the shadow of black star. Pakistan\\u2019s nuclear program became an eyesore for India, Israel and USA. It faced the whole brunt of fallout effects of ten-year Afghan war that had been fully supported by the US led free world. USSR that had shrunk to Russian Federation was highly bitter, while India was perpetually hostile. Iran was not so friendly owing to its reservations over the developments in Afghanistan. Explosive situation in Afghanistan due to civil war and power tussle among the seven Mujahideen groups impacted the security of Pakistan. \\nStart of armed insurgency in IOK in late 1989 and India pumping in over 700,000 troops into the Valley had its effects on Pakistan\\u2019s security dynamics. In 1990/91, both sides had come close to war. Internally, the society had become militarized due to the Afghan war and sectarianism fomented by Iran and Saudi Arabia had created serious law and order situation in Punjab. PPP and PML-N acrimoniously tussled with each other for power because of which no govt could complete its mandatory 5 years tenure. \\nFragmentation of USSR and demise of communism on account of its military defeat in Afghanistan and increase of influence of Pakistan and India decreasing its influence in Afghanistan had vexed India. It feared that Pakistan may exploit the situation in IOK and liberate it with the help of over 60 Jihadi groups and take its revenge of the humiliation it had suffered in East Pakistan in 1971. It dreaded that Pakistan may replicate its model of supporting the Mukti Bahini. Sensing the gravity of the situation, India started propagating that Pakistan is behind the insurgency in IOK and that the ISI is funding, training and launching terrorists from Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK). It urged the UN and world powers to rein in Pakistan and restrain ISI from conducting cross LoC terrorism. \\nThe US, both Republicans and Democrats, had been constantly wooing India to join its camp since early 1950s, but India preferred the Soviet camp, although it professed to be non-aligned. It was elated when India feeling orphaned after the collapse of USSR fell like a ripe apple into the waiting arms of USA and both became bedfellows in 1991. Once its newfound love sought help from her paramour, the latter stood behind her and sternly cautioned Pakistan to lay its hands off IOK. Change in circumstances compelled Pakistan to restrict its support to the Kashmiris in distress to moral, political and diplomatic levels only. The Kashmir oriented Jihadi groups based in AJK and in Southern Punjab however continued to extend support to the Kashmiris seeking right of self-determination as provided for in the UN resolutions. Indian security forces equipped with draconian laws and license to kill without any fear of accountability or censure by the UN and world powers carried out inhuman torture, employed massive force, and used rape as a weapon to break the will of the freedom fighters. The UN and international community turned a deaf ear to the cries of Kashmiris. \\nDespite the fact that IOK had become the most militarized region of the world (one soldier for 17 civilians), and Kashmiris had suffered over 100,000 fatalities, 10,000 rapes, detention of thousands in secret dens and destruction of their property, the freedom fighters kept the torch of liberty aglow. The heroics of Kashmiris against heavy odds had a telling effect on the morale of Indian Army and paramilitary forces in IOK. Soldiers suffered from demoralization and homesickness; cases of suicides, desertions, killing of seniors and comrades by soldiers, and indiscipline jumped up at an alarming rate. Officers and men dreaded posting to Kashmir, while rate of compassionate cases wanting posting out from Kashmir shot up. A stage came when recruitment in Army dropped to rock bottom levels. The then Indian Army chief had to appear on the TV and run an ad campaign to appeal to the youth to join the Army on better pay scale and perks. Kashmir had become a perforated wound for India and economic cost was becoming unbearable. It was becoming difficult for India to hide its massive human rights violations and barbarities of Indian security forces. \\nHere I may add that the Indian Army had suffered humiliation at Dras-Kargil in 1999 at the hands of handful of Mujahideen and irregulars of Northern Light Infantry. It was eventually bailed out by the US led G-8 by exerting immense pressure on Pakistan to immediately vacate the captured territories. The Indian armed forces went through another embarrassment in 2002 when it had to sheepishly withdraw from its western border after a ten-month standoff during which it had constantly huffed and puffed but couldn\\u2019t pick up courage to cross the border. Aggressive response of Pak armed forces had taken the steam out of their chauvinism. \\nUnfortunately, all that was gained on the Kashmir front and on the military front was wasted away after Gen Musharraf wilted under the US pressure in 2003 and decided to take steps to please USA and India. Reining in Kashmir focused Jihadi groups, allowing India to fence the LoC and signing peace treaty with India in January 2004 changed the perspective. It helped Indian military to suppress Kashmir freedom movement. Earlier on, Musharraf had submitted to all the 7 demands of Washington in September 2001. Free hand given to CIA and FBI had enabled the two to establish their network in FATA and gain control over airports and seaport in Pakistan. Intelligence acquisition in FATA was taken over by CIA and ISI pushed on the back seat. \\nIndo-Pak peace treaty in 2004 enabled RAW to ignite FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Baluchistan and Karachi. While RAW assisted by CIA, NDS, MI-6 and Mossad made full use of its long arm to bleed Pakistan with the help of proxies, Pak security forces and ISI remained handicapped. The so-called friends pushed Pakistan to fight terrorism but secretly backed the terrorists. The US kept twisting the arm of Pakistan that if ISI meddled into India or Afghanistan it will be declared a rogue outfit. Perforce, the ISI undertook protective measures only, but its defensive actions were more often breached because the so-called allies stabbed Pakistan in the back. As a consequence, RAW and its strategic partners carried out one-sided covert war while the ISI at best tried to ward off the attacks. In spite of defensive policy of the govt and ISI, and Pakistan suffering much more human casualties than any other country in the war on terror, ISI was blamed to be in collusion with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). These were termed as strategic assets of military establishment to overcome conventional inferiority against arch enemy India. The lost intelligence space In FATA/KP was gradually recovered when Lt Gen Shuja Pasha took over as DG ISI and Gen Ashfaq Kayani as COAS in 2008. \\nAll the terror attacks that took place in India between 2001 and 2008 were pinned on JeM and LeT and their connection was made with ISI. Since Pakistan made no effort to disprove Indian contention even after it was revealed by Indian investigative agencies and Home Ministry officials that Hindu terror groups and Indian military intelligence officers were involved in the attacks, it became easier for India to further strengthen its narrative of portraying Pakistan as a terror abetting state and a nursery of terrorism. India\\u2019s narrative was boosted up by its strategic allies. The US dubbed Pakistan as the most dangerous county in the world. Pakistan\\u2019s overall defensive policy and apologetic stance emboldened its detractors to keep whipping and bleeding it without fear of tit for tat response from ISI. \\nOther than the salvos fired by the Indo-Afghan-US-Israel nexus on Pak Army and ISI, Pakistan political leadership of major political parties also view the two premier institutions with distrust. Both PPP and PML-N in line with their 2006 Charter of Democracy made efforts to enfeeble ISI and keep Army under their thumb. First attempt was made by Benazir Bhutto when she replaced Lt Gen Hamid Gul with retired Lt Gen Kallue in 1989 and next tasked Air Marshal Zulfiqar to cut ISI to size under the garb of reforms. PM Yusaf Raza Gilani tried to civilianize ISI in August 2008 by placing it under Ministry of Interior. Kerry Lugar Bill in 2009 and Memo scandal in 2011 were other attempts to curtail military\\u2019s power. Nawaz Sharif has a history of locking horns with every Army chief and has still not got out of the hangover of Gen Musharraf. Although he didn\\u2019t clash with Gen Raheel but at times civil-military relations became tense. \\nIt has now been conclusively established that RAW and NDS in unison and backed by other agencies are deeply involved in proxy war in Pakistan since 2003 and have inflicted tens of thousands of cuts on the body of Pakistan and its people. Series of conspiracies have been hatched and launched to destabilize and fragment Pakistan. RAW-NDS nexus backed by CIA is continuing to use Afghanistan as a launching pad for terror attacks in Pakistan. In order to scuttle CPEC, focus of attacks is on Baluchistan and KP. India is keeping the LoC on fire. So far it has violated 2003 ceasefire agreement 178 times and killed 19 civilians and injured 80. \\nThe anti-Pakistan foreign agencies are making full use of TTP, Jamaat Ahrar, Lashkar Jhangvi, BLA, BRA, BLF and MQM as proxies. London is a safe haven for MQM leadership and Baloch rebel leaders, while Afghanistan has provided sanctuaries to TTP runaway leaders in Kunar, Nuristan and Nangarhar. Besides these strategic assets, the detractors are also making use of NGOs, human rights activists and segment of media to make Pakistan a compliant state of India. Since HN, JeM, and LeT are not playing the game of foreign agencies, they are dubbed as terrorist groups and strategic assets of Pak Army/ISI. They want Pakistan to take strict action against them or else face isolation and sanctions. \\nIt was in the backdrop of this concern of US and India that the Dawn News published a story on October 6. The planted story was allegedly furnished by someone from within the PM House where a national security conference presided by the PM and attended by Foreign Secretary, Punjab Chief Minister, COAS, DG ISI and National Security Adviser was held. The invented story written by Cyril Almeida gave an impression of serious rift between civil and military leadership and that while the govt wanted to proceed against the defunct militant groups, the ISI didn\\u2019t. Probable motive of concocted story was to demean the Army/ISI and to reinforce Indo-US stance that Pak Army and ISI were in league with terror groups. The types of Hussain Haqqani, Ayesha Sadiqa, Farzana Bari and several other liberal journalists assembled in London two days ago to play up this story. MQM (Altaf) hosted them. To ascertain the truth, a high powered committee comprising members from three intelligence agencies will carry out inquest. \\nHaving collected tons of evidence, yet Pakistan takes the barbs and whips without a whimper and doesn\\u2019t pick up courage to strike back. The long arm of ISI remains sheathed for reasons best known to the policy makers. It implies our leaders have decided to give a free hand to our enemies to continue bleeding Pakistan without any fear of retaliation or even protest. Going by the well-established concept that \\u2018offence is the best defence\\u2019, until and unless the ISI pay back the RAW and NDS in the same coin, one sided bleeding of Pakistanis will continue. Long arm must be unsheathed. \\nThe writer is retired Brig, war veteran, defence analyst, columnist, author of 5 books, Vice Chairman Thinkers Forum Pakistan, DG Measac Research Centre, and Member Executive Council PESS.

If approved by a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. the royalty settlement would bring an end to more than two years of civil and criminal investigations into Mr. Bissonnette, who won several awards for valor in Iraq and Afghanistan before writing \\u201cNo Easy Day,\\u201d his   book on the Bin Laden raid, under the pen name Mark Owen. The firsthand account of the daring raid was one of several   books and movies involving former Navy SEALS that has led to criticism within a community once known for discretion that Mr. Bissonnette and the others were cashing in on their exploits. The Justice Department conducted criminal investigations into whether Mr. Bissonnette had disclosed classified information in his book or speeches and whether he had violated    laws in consulting for companies that had contracts with SEAL Team 6. In the end, the department did not bring any criminal charges, settling instead for the cash forfeitures. Mr. Bissonnette said in a statement Friday that he regretted his failure to submit \\u201cNo Easy Day\\u201d for vetting before it was published in 2012 so Pentagon officials could ensure that it did not include classified information. Mr. Bissonnette acknowledged that he was required under his security clearances to let the Pentagon review the book, and he blamed another lawyer for advising him that he did not need to do so. \\u201cI acknowledge my mistake and have paid a stiff price, both personally and financially, for that error,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI accept responsibility for failing to submit the book for review and apologize sincerely for my oversight. \\u201d Documents filed in Federal District Court in Alexandria on Friday indicated that Mr. Bissonnette must transfer nearly $6. 8 million to the government as part of the settlement. The amount includes all of the $6. 7 million in royalties he has earned on \\u201cNo Easy Day,\\u201d as well as $100, 000 in fees for six speeches he gave in early 2013 before the government approved the slides he used in such presentations. Mr. Bissonnette wrote in \\u201cNo Easy Day\\u201d that he was one of the SEALs who shot Bin Laden, and he and Robert O\\u2019Neill, another former SEAL Team 6 member who claims his shots were the fatal ones, have competed on the lecture circuit. Military officials said that Mr. O\\u2019Neill is writing a book of his own and has asked the Pentagon to vet it. While Mr. Bissonnette\\u2019s fight with the Pentagon over his book has received public attention, some details of his consulting work while he was still a SEAL Team 6 member, as well as his fee forfeiture, have not been disclosed. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and the federal authorities reached a \\u201cnonprosecution agreement\\u201d in May in which Mr. Bissonnette forfeited $180, 000 in fees for advising three equipment manufacturers who were doing business with SEAL Team 6 while he was on the team. Mr. Luskin said the fees dated back as far as 2006, when Mr. Bissonnette was the research and development representative for his squadron within Team 6. Other former SEAL members have said that his job was to figure out what types of equipment they needed. Mr. Luskin said that the $180, 000 came from   a helmet maker now owned by the Gentex Corporation in Carbondale, Pa. and two   manufacturers based in Virginia Beach  \\u2014   SS Precision and London Bridge Trading. No executives at the three companies were available for comment. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and other SEAL members also received consulting fees from companies that designed tactical clothing and gear for other parts of the military or for sales to outdoor enthusiasts. Mr. Bissonnette has maintained that he cleared the consulting work in advance with a Navy lawyer, and Mr. Luskin said that helped persuade prosecutors that \\u201cthere was clearly on Matt\\u2019s part no intent to breach the    laws. \\u201d Navy officials say they have restricted such moonlighting since then. Mr. Luskin also noted that a number of   officials have assisted other authors writing about the Bin Laden raid as well as the creators of the movie \\u201cZero Dark Thirty. \\u201d But, he said, only Mr. Bissonnette has paid any penalties for the disclosures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0447\\u0442\\u043e\\u0431\\u044b \\u044d\\u0442\\u043e \\u0431\\u044b\\u043b\\u0430 \\u0434\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u0433\\u0430 \\u0441 \\u0434\\u0432\\u0443\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u043d\\u0438\\u043c \\u0434\\u0432\\u0438\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435\\u043c.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It\\u2019s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator. So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again. And, yes, together we will make America great again. Trump\\u2019s inaugural address, reportedly written by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior advisor Stephen Miller, was criticized as aggressive, but it was largely an effort to explain what he meant by \\u201cMake America Great Again,\\u201d which is (thankfully!) a very aggressive idea. For an example of a passive campaign theme, try \\u201cHope and Change. \\u201d There is nothing more passive than lying around and hoping some Santa Claus politician comes along with a bag of other people\\u2019s money to fix your life.  Trump was also criticized for delivering an inaugural address that sounded too much like his campaign speeches. This was necessary, because the mainstream media didn\\u2019t relay enough of what he said on the stump. They were too busy freaking out over whatever \\u201coutrageous\\u201d thing he said at any given rally.  It was appropriate for Trump to succinctly explain his platform to the widest audience he\\u2019ll ever have, both within and beyond America\\u2019s borders, with no media filter. Until now, most of the media commentary on \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d consisted of whining about how unfair it was to the inexplicably   Barack Obama, mixed with the occasional lefty primal scream about how America was never great to begin with. Perhaps most importantly, Trump used his inaugural to beat down the asinine smear of \\u201cwhite nationalism. \\u201d His talk of national pride has been corrupted to mean unthinking national chauvinism by the Left. \\u201cAmerica first\\u201d is twisted to mean \\u201cscrew everybody but America\\u201d (or, in the hands of the more mendacious critics, \\u201cscrew the Jews. \\u201d) Then it gets twisted even further by welding the unspoken word \\u201cwhite\\u201d onto \\u201cnationalism,\\u201d transforming it into a racist call to arms. The number of actual white nationalists who talk about white nationalism is vastly smaller than the number of liberals who insist that\\u2019s what they hear when Trump talks about \\u201cAmerican pride. \\u201d Maybe it\\u2019s time for liberals to check in with their therapists and have a long talk about why they hear so many racist dog whistles. In his inaugural, Trump could not have been more clear about the inclusiveness of his vision for American pride. \\u201cWhether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots\\u201d is about as clear as it gets.  Of course, the usual   media swamis will declare they\\u2019ve looked inside Trump\\u2019s mind, and he didn\\u2019t really mean that. He just threw those words in because Kellyanne told him he needed a little racism insurance. But everything about that speech, and everything Trump has said about resurgent American pride, and everything said by the people who want to reclaim nationalism from chauvinism, is inclusive. The point is to insist on both national priorities and national responsibilities, for everyone from   citizens at the immigration office to President Trump and his Cabinet.  The woman from Mexico who took her oath of citizenship yesterday is 100% American. The man from Mexico who slipped across the border in a coyote truck yesterday is not. President Trump has a long list of sacred duties to the woman, but not to the man. This is not a complicated idea, or a racist one, or really even a nationalist one. It\\u2019s Civics 101. It\\u2019s also the idea global socialism must strangle, in order to survive. Liberals who rail against \\u201cnationalism\\u201d are primarily interested in creating a world of zero accountability for their maximum leaders. With borders erased, the Ruling Class can hack the electorate to suit its political needs, and their business partners can slash the cost of labor. \\u201cInternationalist\\u201d leaders are accountable to no nation\\u2019s citizens. Trump\\u2019s inaugural address included a bold statement of the opposite principle. America\\u2019s president has neither control, nor responsibility, over the economies of other nations. He is responsible to Americans, from Nebraska to Detroit, as Trump put it. He set a very high bar for himself to clear by pointedly mentioning Detroit.  He also made a promise that no group will be preyed upon for the advantages of another. To be the president of all Americans means he is the sugar daddy of none. No more will the power of government be used to penalize groups the Left hates, and beat them into line with new social orthodoxies. No more will Washington dream up economic plans that benefit some, or even most, while designating certain \\u201cforgotten people\\u201d as lifetime losers who need to shut up and accept their fate.  Trump referred to \\u201cwealth\\u201d several times in his speech. \\u201cWealth\\u201d means more than just money. Wealth benefits all, no matter how loudly socialists may screech about too much of it accruing to the One Percent. Some people got very rich by designing, building, and selling the device you\\u2019re staring at right now. You are wealthier than your grandparents, because you have it. As for a proud America\\u2019s proper relationship with other nations, Trump said: We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. That\\u2019s not chauvinism, or imperialism. That\\u2019s the understanding America was founded upon. When Thomas Jefferson took his turn at the presidential bat, he called for \\u201cpeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none. \\u201d No one interpreted that to mean \\u201cto Hell with the rest of the world. \\u201d Also, not to put too fine a point on it, but just about every other nation on Earth understands the concept of putting its own interests first, and believes it has a moral obligation to do so. The leaders of some other nations are very good at murmuring sweet globalist nothings into the ears of   elites, but what they actually do is ruthlessly pursue their own national interests. The charade is made much easier for them by the universal understanding that America is supposed to be the one country that never gets to look out for itself, that has no moral right to protect its own interests. Those are all much easier promises to make than keep, to be sure, but Trump did make them. It is wise to be skeptical, and hold his feet to the very large fire he built with that inaugural address.\",\n          \"By Brig Asif H. Raja on November 1, 2016 \\nAsif Haroon Raja \\nThe ISI had developed its long arm capability during the tenures of Gen Akhtar Abdur Rehman, Lt Gen Hamid Gul (VT editor) and Lt Gen Javed Nasir as DG ISI. It was owing to this capability of hitting the chosen target outside the frontiers of Pakistan that the ISI earned the reputation of a dreaded outfit and the best in Asia. The long arm began to shrivel when Benazir Bhutto was PM from 1988 to 1990 and Gen Waheed Kakar was COAS and Lt Gen Javed Ashraf Qazi had replaced Gen Javed Nasir. This change in posture was a result of pressure of the US and the West, pressing Pakistan to refrain from meddling in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) and in India, or else it will be declared a terrorist state. Pressure was mounted at the behest of India which had become strategic partner of USA and Israel in 1991/1992 and darling of the West. \\nAfter the occupation of Afghanistan by 1, 50,000 Soviet forces in December 1979, Pakistan under Gen Ziaul Haq had decided to provide refuge to about 5 million Afghan refugees and to support the Afghan Mujahideen in their resistance. The US came forward with a package of $ 3.5 billion in June 1981 after making a measured assessment that Pakistan had the will and capability to fight the proxy war. The offer was accepted only when it was conveyed that the ISI will coordinate and conduct the entire war without the aid of CIA and that the US and others would restrict their support to provision of funds and weapons/equipment only. As a Frontline State, Pakistan suffered a great deal throughout the Afghan war at the hands of KGB-KHAD-RAW-AlZulfiqar nexus and Afghan armed forces, but achieved the miracle by defeating and pushing out Soviet forces in February 1989. After achieving its objective without employing a single soldier, the US abandoned Pakistan as well as the Mujahideen who had sacrificed 1.5 million people and had helped the US in becoming a sole super power. \\nOnce Pakistan fell from the grace of USA and it was put under sanctions on account of its covert nuclear program suspected to be geared towards making an Islamic bomb, it came under the shadow of black star. Pakistan\\u2019s nuclear program became an eyesore for India, Israel and USA. It faced the whole brunt of fallout effects of ten-year Afghan war that had been fully supported by the US led free world. USSR that had shrunk to Russian Federation was highly bitter, while India was perpetually hostile. Iran was not so friendly owing to its reservations over the developments in Afghanistan. Explosive situation in Afghanistan due to civil war and power tussle among the seven Mujahideen groups impacted the security of Pakistan. \\nStart of armed insurgency in IOK in late 1989 and India pumping in over 700,000 troops into the Valley had its effects on Pakistan\\u2019s security dynamics. In 1990/91, both sides had come close to war. Internally, the society had become militarized due to the Afghan war and sectarianism fomented by Iran and Saudi Arabia had created serious law and order situation in Punjab. PPP and PML-N acrimoniously tussled with each other for power because of which no govt could complete its mandatory 5 years tenure. \\nFragmentation of USSR and demise of communism on account of its military defeat in Afghanistan and increase of influence of Pakistan and India decreasing its influence in Afghanistan had vexed India. It feared that Pakistan may exploit the situation in IOK and liberate it with the help of over 60 Jihadi groups and take its revenge of the humiliation it had suffered in East Pakistan in 1971. It dreaded that Pakistan may replicate its model of supporting the Mukti Bahini. Sensing the gravity of the situation, India started propagating that Pakistan is behind the insurgency in IOK and that the ISI is funding, training and launching terrorists from Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK). It urged the UN and world powers to rein in Pakistan and restrain ISI from conducting cross LoC terrorism. \\nThe US, both Republicans and Democrats, had been constantly wooing India to join its camp since early 1950s, but India preferred the Soviet camp, although it professed to be non-aligned. It was elated when India feeling orphaned after the collapse of USSR fell like a ripe apple into the waiting arms of USA and both became bedfellows in 1991. Once its newfound love sought help from her paramour, the latter stood behind her and sternly cautioned Pakistan to lay its hands off IOK. Change in circumstances compelled Pakistan to restrict its support to the Kashmiris in distress to moral, political and diplomatic levels only. The Kashmir oriented Jihadi groups based in AJK and in Southern Punjab however continued to extend support to the Kashmiris seeking right of self-determination as provided for in the UN resolutions. Indian security forces equipped with draconian laws and license to kill without any fear of accountability or censure by the UN and world powers carried out inhuman torture, employed massive force, and used rape as a weapon to break the will of the freedom fighters. The UN and international community turned a deaf ear to the cries of Kashmiris. \\nDespite the fact that IOK had become the most militarized region of the world (one soldier for 17 civilians), and Kashmiris had suffered over 100,000 fatalities, 10,000 rapes, detention of thousands in secret dens and destruction of their property, the freedom fighters kept the torch of liberty aglow. The heroics of Kashmiris against heavy odds had a telling effect on the morale of Indian Army and paramilitary forces in IOK. Soldiers suffered from demoralization and homesickness; cases of suicides, desertions, killing of seniors and comrades by soldiers, and indiscipline jumped up at an alarming rate. Officers and men dreaded posting to Kashmir, while rate of compassionate cases wanting posting out from Kashmir shot up. A stage came when recruitment in Army dropped to rock bottom levels. The then Indian Army chief had to appear on the TV and run an ad campaign to appeal to the youth to join the Army on better pay scale and perks. Kashmir had become a perforated wound for India and economic cost was becoming unbearable. It was becoming difficult for India to hide its massive human rights violations and barbarities of Indian security forces. \\nHere I may add that the Indian Army had suffered humiliation at Dras-Kargil in 1999 at the hands of handful of Mujahideen and irregulars of Northern Light Infantry. It was eventually bailed out by the US led G-8 by exerting immense pressure on Pakistan to immediately vacate the captured territories. The Indian armed forces went through another embarrassment in 2002 when it had to sheepishly withdraw from its western border after a ten-month standoff during which it had constantly huffed and puffed but couldn\\u2019t pick up courage to cross the border. Aggressive response of Pak armed forces had taken the steam out of their chauvinism. \\nUnfortunately, all that was gained on the Kashmir front and on the military front was wasted away after Gen Musharraf wilted under the US pressure in 2003 and decided to take steps to please USA and India. Reining in Kashmir focused Jihadi groups, allowing India to fence the LoC and signing peace treaty with India in January 2004 changed the perspective. It helped Indian military to suppress Kashmir freedom movement. Earlier on, Musharraf had submitted to all the 7 demands of Washington in September 2001. Free hand given to CIA and FBI had enabled the two to establish their network in FATA and gain control over airports and seaport in Pakistan. Intelligence acquisition in FATA was taken over by CIA and ISI pushed on the back seat. \\nIndo-Pak peace treaty in 2004 enabled RAW to ignite FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Baluchistan and Karachi. While RAW assisted by CIA, NDS, MI-6 and Mossad made full use of its long arm to bleed Pakistan with the help of proxies, Pak security forces and ISI remained handicapped. The so-called friends pushed Pakistan to fight terrorism but secretly backed the terrorists. The US kept twisting the arm of Pakistan that if ISI meddled into India or Afghanistan it will be declared a rogue outfit. Perforce, the ISI undertook protective measures only, but its defensive actions were more often breached because the so-called allies stabbed Pakistan in the back. As a consequence, RAW and its strategic partners carried out one-sided covert war while the ISI at best tried to ward off the attacks. In spite of defensive policy of the govt and ISI, and Pakistan suffering much more human casualties than any other country in the war on terror, ISI was blamed to be in collusion with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). These were termed as strategic assets of military establishment to overcome conventional inferiority against arch enemy India. The lost intelligence space In FATA/KP was gradually recovered when Lt Gen Shuja Pasha took over as DG ISI and Gen Ashfaq Kayani as COAS in 2008. \\nAll the terror attacks that took place in India between 2001 and 2008 were pinned on JeM and LeT and their connection was made with ISI. Since Pakistan made no effort to disprove Indian contention even after it was revealed by Indian investigative agencies and Home Ministry officials that Hindu terror groups and Indian military intelligence officers were involved in the attacks, it became easier for India to further strengthen its narrative of portraying Pakistan as a terror abetting state and a nursery of terrorism. India\\u2019s narrative was boosted up by its strategic allies. The US dubbed Pakistan as the most dangerous county in the world. Pakistan\\u2019s overall defensive policy and apologetic stance emboldened its detractors to keep whipping and bleeding it without fear of tit for tat response from ISI. \\nOther than the salvos fired by the Indo-Afghan-US-Israel nexus on Pak Army and ISI, Pakistan political leadership of major political parties also view the two premier institutions with distrust. Both PPP and PML-N in line with their 2006 Charter of Democracy made efforts to enfeeble ISI and keep Army under their thumb. First attempt was made by Benazir Bhutto when she replaced Lt Gen Hamid Gul with retired Lt Gen Kallue in 1989 and next tasked Air Marshal Zulfiqar to cut ISI to size under the garb of reforms. PM Yusaf Raza Gilani tried to civilianize ISI in August 2008 by placing it under Ministry of Interior. Kerry Lugar Bill in 2009 and Memo scandal in 2011 were other attempts to curtail military\\u2019s power. Nawaz Sharif has a history of locking horns with every Army chief and has still not got out of the hangover of Gen Musharraf. Although he didn\\u2019t clash with Gen Raheel but at times civil-military relations became tense. \\nIt has now been conclusively established that RAW and NDS in unison and backed by other agencies are deeply involved in proxy war in Pakistan since 2003 and have inflicted tens of thousands of cuts on the body of Pakistan and its people. Series of conspiracies have been hatched and launched to destabilize and fragment Pakistan. RAW-NDS nexus backed by CIA is continuing to use Afghanistan as a launching pad for terror attacks in Pakistan. In order to scuttle CPEC, focus of attacks is on Baluchistan and KP. India is keeping the LoC on fire. So far it has violated 2003 ceasefire agreement 178 times and killed 19 civilians and injured 80. \\nThe anti-Pakistan foreign agencies are making full use of TTP, Jamaat Ahrar, Lashkar Jhangvi, BLA, BRA, BLF and MQM as proxies. London is a safe haven for MQM leadership and Baloch rebel leaders, while Afghanistan has provided sanctuaries to TTP runaway leaders in Kunar, Nuristan and Nangarhar. Besides these strategic assets, the detractors are also making use of NGOs, human rights activists and segment of media to make Pakistan a compliant state of India. Since HN, JeM, and LeT are not playing the game of foreign agencies, they are dubbed as terrorist groups and strategic assets of Pak Army/ISI. They want Pakistan to take strict action against them or else face isolation and sanctions. \\nIt was in the backdrop of this concern of US and India that the Dawn News published a story on October 6. The planted story was allegedly furnished by someone from within the PM House where a national security conference presided by the PM and attended by Foreign Secretary, Punjab Chief Minister, COAS, DG ISI and National Security Adviser was held. The invented story written by Cyril Almeida gave an impression of serious rift between civil and military leadership and that while the govt wanted to proceed against the defunct militant groups, the ISI didn\\u2019t. Probable motive of concocted story was to demean the Army/ISI and to reinforce Indo-US stance that Pak Army and ISI were in league with terror groups. The types of Hussain Haqqani, Ayesha Sadiqa, Farzana Bari and several other liberal journalists assembled in London two days ago to play up this story. MQM (Altaf) hosted them. To ascertain the truth, a high powered committee comprising members from three intelligence agencies will carry out inquest. \\nHaving collected tons of evidence, yet Pakistan takes the barbs and whips without a whimper and doesn\\u2019t pick up courage to strike back. The long arm of ISI remains sheathed for reasons best known to the policy makers. It implies our leaders have decided to give a free hand to our enemies to continue bleeding Pakistan without any fear of retaliation or even protest. Going by the well-established concept that \\u2018offence is the best defence\\u2019, until and unless the ISI pay back the RAW and NDS in the same coin, one sided bleeding of Pakistanis will continue. Long arm must be unsheathed. \\nThe writer is retired Brig, war veteran, defence analyst, columnist, author of 5 books, Vice Chairman Thinkers Forum Pakistan, DG Measac Research Centre, and Member Executive Council PESS. Related Posts:\",\n          \"Matt Bissonnette, a former member of Navy SEAL Team 6 who wrote an account of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, agreed on Friday to forfeit $6. 8 million in book royalties and speaking fees and apologized for failing to clear his disclosures with the Pentagon, according to federal court documents. Mr. Bissonnette also recently forfeited $180, 000 in fees for consulting work that he did for military contractors while he was still on the SEAL team, his lawyer, Robert D. Luskin, said in an interview. If approved by a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. the royalty settlement would bring an end to more than two years of civil and criminal investigations into Mr. Bissonnette, who won several awards for valor in Iraq and Afghanistan before writing \\u201cNo Easy Day,\\u201d his   book on the Bin Laden raid, under the pen name Mark Owen. The firsthand account of the daring raid was one of several   books and movies involving former Navy SEALS that has led to criticism within a community once known for discretion that Mr. Bissonnette and the others were cashing in on their exploits. The Justice Department conducted criminal investigations into whether Mr. Bissonnette had disclosed classified information in his book or speeches and whether he had violated    laws in consulting for companies that had contracts with SEAL Team 6. In the end, the department did not bring any criminal charges, settling instead for the cash forfeitures. Mr. Bissonnette said in a statement Friday that he regretted his failure to submit \\u201cNo Easy Day\\u201d for vetting before it was published in 2012 so Pentagon officials could ensure that it did not include classified information. Mr. Bissonnette acknowledged that he was required under his security clearances to let the Pentagon review the book, and he blamed another lawyer for advising him that he did not need to do so. \\u201cI acknowledge my mistake and have paid a stiff price, both personally and financially, for that error,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI accept responsibility for failing to submit the book for review and apologize sincerely for my oversight. \\u201d Documents filed in Federal District Court in Alexandria on Friday indicated that Mr. Bissonnette must transfer nearly $6. 8 million to the government as part of the settlement. The amount includes all of the $6. 7 million in royalties he has earned on \\u201cNo Easy Day,\\u201d as well as $100, 000 in fees for six speeches he gave in early 2013 before the government approved the slides he used in such presentations. Mr. Bissonnette wrote in \\u201cNo Easy Day\\u201d that he was one of the SEALs who shot Bin Laden, and he and Robert O\\u2019Neill, another former SEAL Team 6 member who claims his shots were the fatal ones, have competed on the lecture circuit. Military officials said that Mr. O\\u2019Neill is writing a book of his own and has asked the Pentagon to vet it. While Mr. Bissonnette\\u2019s fight with the Pentagon over his book has received public attention, some details of his consulting work while he was still a SEAL Team 6 member, as well as his fee forfeiture, have not been disclosed. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and the federal authorities reached a \\u201cnonprosecution agreement\\u201d in May in which Mr. Bissonnette forfeited $180, 000 in fees for advising three equipment manufacturers who were doing business with SEAL Team 6 while he was on the team. Mr. Luskin said the fees dated back as far as 2006, when Mr. Bissonnette was the research and development representative for his squadron within Team 6. Other former SEAL members have said that his job was to figure out what types of equipment they needed. Mr. Luskin said that the $180, 000 came from   a helmet maker now owned by the Gentex Corporation in Carbondale, Pa. and two   manufacturers based in Virginia Beach  \\u2014   SS Precision and London Bridge Trading. No executives at the three companies were available for comment. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and other SEAL members also received consulting fees from companies that designed tactical clothing and gear for other parts of the military or for sales to outdoor enthusiasts. Mr. Bissonnette has maintained that he cleared the consulting work in advance with a Navy lawyer, and Mr. Luskin said that helped persuade prosecutors that \\u201cthere was clearly on Matt\\u2019s part no intent to breach the    laws. \\u201d Navy officials say they have restricted such moonlighting since then. Mr. Luskin also noted that a number of   officials have assisted other authors writing about the Bin Laden raid as well as the creators of the movie \\u201cZero Dark Thirty. \\u201d But, he said, only Mr. Bissonnette has paid any penalties for the disclosures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0447\\u0442\\u043e\\u0431\\u044b \\u044d\\u0442\\u043e \\u0431\\u044b\\u043b\\u0430 \\u0434\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u0433\\u0430 \\u0441 \\u0434\\u0432\\u0443\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u043d\\u0438\\u043c \\u0434\\u0432\\u0438\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435\\u043c.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Yet today millions of children across our nation find themselves trapped in failing schools, barring them from the chance to receive the education they need to climb out of poverty and up the economic ladder. [All parents and students who want educational choice should have it. Yet in Texas alone, 105, 000 kids are waiting to be admitted to charter schools, and throughout the nation, more than a million children await acceptance into charter schools.  While there remains an enormous task before us to give every child access to a quality education, I am encouraged by progress that has been made in my home state of Texas. Since 2000, the number of charter schools in Texas has more than tripled. And currently before the Texas Legislature are significant measures that will continue to expand school choice across our state. The facts are unequivocal  \\u2014   school choice improves students\\u2019 test scores, keeps them in school longer, saves taxpayer dollars, provides a safer learning environment, and increases competition and quality in traditional public schools. School choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century  \\u2014   it\\u2019s opening doors for children to pursue their talents and ambitions, and it\\u2019s providing some of our poorest students a ticket to a better life and more promising future. Now is the time to open the gateway of opportunity to children across the country. We need to expand charters, vouchers, education savings account programs, and educational options for all children, regardless of their race, ethnicity or zip code. Today, Texans are rallying in Austin to raise awareness for the opportunities the Texas Legislature has this session to make meaningful inroads in further expanding school choice across our state. I stand in support of them and proudly stand with our state leaders, like Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and many others who are working hard to make the dream of education equality a reality. Together, we can unlock the gates of opportunity, and unleash the potential of every child to become the next success story in our nation\\u2019s long history of exceptionalism.\",\n          \"A single concussion experienced by a child or teenager may have lasting repercussions on mental health and intellectual and physical functioning throughout adulthood, and multiple head injuries increase the risks of later problems, according to one of the largest, most elaborate studies to date of the impacts of head trauma on the young. You cannot be an athlete, parent of an athlete, sports fan or reader of this newspaper and not be aware that concussions appear to be both more common  \\u2014   and more dangerous  \\u2014   than most of us once thought. According to a report released last week by the health insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield, based on data from medical claims nationwide, the incidence of diagnosed concussions among people under the age of 20 climbed 71 percent between 2010 and 2015. The rates rose most steeply among girls, with the incidence soaring by 119 percent during that time, although almost twice as many concussions over all were diagnosed in boys. The report acknowledges that the startling increase may partly reflect a growing awareness of the injury among parents, sports officials and physicians, which has led to more diagnoses. But the sheer numbers also suggest that more young people, particularly young athletes, are experiencing head injuries than in the past. Similar increases have been noted among young people in other nations. But the consequences, if any, for their health during adulthood have largely remained unknown. So for the new study, which was funded primarily by the Wellcome Trust and published in August in PLOS Medicine, scientists from Oxford University, Indiana University, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and other universities turned to an extensive trove of data about the health of people in Sweden. A plethora of linked registries in that nation contain information about people\\u2019s medical and hospital visits, socioeconomic status, education, physical disabilities and other aspects of their lives, says Dr. Seena Fazel, a professor of forensic psychiatry at Oxford and the new study\\u2019s senior author. The registries also allow researchers to compile information about family members. In this case, the scientists concentrated on all Swedes born between 1973 and 1985 and looked for those who had experienced a head injury of some kind before the age of 25. More than 104, 000 people qualified. The researchers pulled data about these people for 40 years or until someone had either died or emigrated from Sweden. For each participant, the researchers also compiled comparable medical and other records for a sibling who had never been given a diagnosis of a head injury and compared outcomes both between family members and against the full population of the country. The results were discomfiting. Young people who had experienced a single diagnosed concussion  \\u2014   which the researchers categorized as a mild traumatic brain injury  \\u2014   were much more likely than the nation\\u2019s general population and than their own siblings to be receiving medical disability payments as adults. They also were significantly more likely to have sought mental health care and much less likely to have graduated from high school or to have attended college than their uninjured brother or sister. And they were about twice as likely as an uninjured sibling to die prematurely. The possibility of lingering physical or psychological problems during adulthood rose precipitously, the researchers found, if someone had experienced more than one concussion while young, or if his or her brain injury had been more severe than a concussion. The outcomes also generally were worse if someone had experienced head trauma after the age of 15, probably because the brain is less resilient than in earlier childhood, Dr. Fazel says. (The researchers did not quantify the causes of the injuries in this study, but past research shows that in the very young, he says, brain injuries usually result from falls, with sports becoming the primary cause in teenagers, and auto accidents the main cause among young adults.) There was, thankfully, encouraging news squirreled away within the data. While young people who had been hit in the head displayed heightened risks for physical and psychological difficulties as adults, most, in fact, were fine. \\u201cThe majority of individuals who had diagnoses of brain injury in our study did not experience adverse outcomes,\\u201d Dr. Fazel says. Unfortunately, it is impossible at the moment to identify which children or teenagers who experience head trauma may be most at risk of struggling in later life and which will instead recover without apparent complications, he says. So the message of this study further underscores that, whenever possible, we should take steps to prevent childhood head injuries. While \\u201cthere are lots of benefits from sports,\\u201d Dr. Fazel says, it may be important to consider changes to the rules or equipment in contact sports, like football and soccer, to try to reduce head trauma. If a young person does suffer head trauma, he continues, more and   monitoring is also probably a good idea. Such monitoring may be especially important if the child shows any signs of \\u201ca decline in psychosocial performance,\\u201d he says, such as a drop in grades or a change, even subtle, in personality. A neurologist can provide useful assessments, and regular   neurological assessments may need to be continued, even into adulthood.\",\n          \"Bob Waldrop, founder of the Oscar Romero Catholic Worker House in Oklahoma City, is calling for a boycott of the 2016 national collection in Catholic churches for the Archdiocese of Military Services, accusing the military bishops of material cooperation with the objective evil of unjust war. To facilitate the boycott, he has prepared a half page document that can be printed and placed in the collection plate or offering envelope the weekend of November 5-6, 2016, when the offering is to be collected. A PDF version of the document is available at www.justpeace.org/mscollection.pdf . This has two copies on one page to facilitate distribution.\\nText of the boycott call:\\nI am not giving to the 2016 Archdiocese for Military Services Collection.\\nThe bishops of the Archdiocese for Military Services, together with nearly all of their brother United States Bishops, are guilty of material cooperation with the objective evil of unjust war . In 2003, both Pope John Paul II and then Cardinal Ratzinger , who later became Benedict XVI, condemned our attack on Iraq as an unjust war. In spite of the Pope\\u2019s opposition, the Most Rev. Edwin O\\u2019Brien , then Archbishop for the Military Services advised Catholic members of the US Armed Forces: \\u201cGiven the complexity of factors involved, many of which understandably remain confidential, it is altogether appropriate for members of our armed forces to presume the integrity of our leadership and its judgments and therefore to carry out their military duties in good conscience.\\u201d\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nSubsequent events have sadly proven the truth, wisdom, and prudence of Pope John Paul II\\u2019s judgment, and the fallacy and danger of the moral relativism embraced by the Bishops of the Archdiocese for Military Services and most of the other US Catholic Bishops regarding unjust war. The consequences cascading from our invasion brought death and injury and social dislocation to hundreds of thousands and devastated the historic Christian communities of Iraq and subsequently Syria. It may fairly be said that those who enabled and supported the war on the people of Iraq are \\\"secondary terrorists\\\" in that they created the objective conditions on the ground in the Middle East that are driving the extreme forms of terrorism currently prevalent in the region. Actions have consequences and those who propose the actions must own the consequences.\\nTherefore, because of these issues, I am not giving to the collection for the Archdiocese of Military Services. Instead, I will donate to an organization working to resolve the problems caused by war.\\nIt is a sad and scandalous day when a people\\u2019s religious leaders fail them so egregiously. I promise to pray for the conversion of the Military Services hierarchy and clergy, and for the moral and physical protection of the members of our Armed Services, who are our sisters, brothers, fathers, mothers, and children. They deserve religious leaders who will courageously preach and teach all of the Gospel of Christ, not just that which is acceptable to the United States Government.\\nText prepared by Bob Waldrop, Oscar Romero Catholic Worker House, Oklahoma City.

With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night, the team fulfilled Rodgers\\u2019 promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants, thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams, but the N. F. C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team\\u2019s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done, ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks\\u2019 title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury, the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions, who lost their final three games, blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East, home of the   Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas, Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. \\u2019s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17\\u2019s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team\\u2019s quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the team\\u2019s   running back, they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami\\u2019s middling defense, even if Tannehill\\u2019s knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England, Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the Redskins\\u2019 plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the team\\u2019s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs\\u2019   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carr\\u2019s backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia.\",\n          \"  David Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

What Keeps the F-35 Alive By David Swanson on October 31, 2016 Petition to Stop F-35 Going Global \\nby David Swanson \\nImagine if a local business in your town invented a brand new tool that was intended to have an almost magical effect thousands of miles away. However, where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children. Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones, lower reading skills, poorer memories, impaired auditory and speech perception, and impaired academic performance. \\nMost of us would find this situation at least a little concerning, unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people. Then it\\u2019d be just fine. \\nNow, imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldn\\u2019t safely live near it. Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool. Again, I think, we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission. \\nImagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes, emitting highly toxic chemicals, particles, and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around. Normally, that\\u2019d be a problem. But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people, we\\u2019ll work with its flaws, won\\u2019t we? \\nNow, what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least $1,400,000,000,000 over 50 years? And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world? What if the $1.4 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education, healthcare, housing, environmental protection, or humanitarian aid? Wouldn\\u2019t that be a worry in some cases, I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasn\\u2019t at stake? \\nWhat if this product, even when working perfectly, was a leading destroyer of the earth\\u2019s natural environment? \\nWhat if this high-tech toy wasn\\u2019t even designed to do what was expected of it and wasn\\u2019t even able to do what it was designed for? \\nAmazingly, even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction. Then, all is forgiven. \\nThe tool I\\u2019m describing is called the F-35. At RootsAction.org you can find a new petition launched by locally-minded people acting globally in places where the F-35 is intended to be based. Also at that link you\\u2019ll find explanations of how the tool I\\u2019ve been decribing is the F-35. \\nThe petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington, Vermont, and Fairbanks, Alaska, where the F-35 is to be based. This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition, Save Our Skies Vermont, Western Maine Matters, Alaska Peace Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club, North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace, World Beyond War, RootsAction.org, Code Pink, and Ben Cohen. \\nThe petition reads: \\nThe F-35 is a weapon of offensive war, serving no defensive purpose. It is planned to cost the U.S. $1.4 trillion over 50 years. Because starvation on earth could be ended for $30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for $11 billion per year, it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill. Military spending, contrary to popular misconception, also hurts the U.S. economy ( see here ) and other economies. The F-35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases. It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use. It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes. Its emissions are a major environmental polluter. \\nWars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them. Nonviolent tools of law, diplomacy, aid, crisis prevention, and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars. Therefore, we, the undersigned, call for the immediate cancellation of the F-35 program as a whole, and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas. We oppose replacing the F-35 with any other weapon or basing the F-35 in any other locations. We further demand redirection of the money for the F-35 back into taxpayers\\u2019 pockets, and into environmental and human needs in the U.S., other F-35 customer nations, and around the world, including to fight climate change, pay off student debt, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and improve education, healthcare, and housing. \\nAdd your name . \\nDavid Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further, combining with Macy\\u2019s to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling. Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company, the Canadian owner of Saks, has approached Macy\\u2019s about a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday. Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale. While it is unclear whether a deal will happen, a combination could lift the fortunes of Macy\\u2019s, the country\\u2019s biggest department store, which has been struggling. Investors certainly appeared to see it that way. Shares of Macy\\u2019s rose as much as 12 percent on Friday, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11, according to data from Bloomberg. Once a retail titan, Macy\\u2019s has struggled to remain relevant as   and discount retailers have decimated the traditional    business. Last month, Macy\\u2019s announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close some of its 880 stores. Terry Lundgren, its chief executive and the architect of Macy\\u2019s last big merger, is expected to step down by the end of March. He will be succeeded by the company\\u2019s president, Jeffrey Gennette. Since the recession, shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price. Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished. Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices, which cuts into their margins. Departments stores have been hit especially hard, particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls. What has emerged, analysts say, is a virtual race to the bottom. That has been particularly difficult for Macy\\u2019s, born of a series of mergers over the past two decades that made it a juggernaut in the industry. A stalwart of the middle tier of retail, the company has neither the advantages of   retailers like HM nor the   stores. In addition, Macy\\u2019s faces increasingly fierce competition online from sites like Amazon and elsewhere. Macy\\u2019s troubles have drawn the attention of a prominent activist hedge fund, Starboard Value, which has urged the company to generate cash by selling the real estate beneath its stores. Starboard, which held just under 1 percent of Macy\\u2019s shares as of Sept. 30, had previously estimated the value of that land at about $21 billion. On Friday, analysts at Citigroup estimated that Macy\\u2019s   holdings could be worth at least $18 billion. Macy\\u2019s market value, by comparison, was just under $11 billion as of Friday morning. Macy\\u2019s has taken some steps to sell or redevelop stores, and last year, it added an expert on real estate transactions to its board. But the company has largely resisted more ambitious efforts to divest its real estate, including     deals, in which a company sells the underlying land beneath its stores and then rents it back. The company\\u2019s suitor, Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company, is far smaller  \\u2014   its market value was about 1. 9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1. 5 billion  \\u2014   but is known for its bold steps. Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company has assembled a growing empire that includes the Hudson\\u2019s Bay department store chain, Lord  Taylor and its crown jewel, Saks. And the governor and executive chairman of the Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company, Richard Baker, has shown little fear of using debt: In November 2014, the company borrowed nearly $4 billion against the Saks flagship in Midtown Manhattan. He has spoken often of retailers\\u2019 need to highlight the value of their real estate. Financing a bid for Macy\\u2019s may be trickier, however, because the it carries about $6. 5 billion in   debt. That may mean that the Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company will have to bring in a partner or borrow against more of its real estate holdings. A spokesman for the Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company declined to comment on the talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. \\u201cWe do not comment on rumors and speculation,\\u201d a representative for Macy\\u2019s said. A representative for Starboard Value did not respond to a request for comment.

The future and sustainability of Sonoma County agriculture was also at hand during the contest race between organic farmer Linda Hopkins and former state Senator Noreen Evans for the District Five Board of Supervisors seat. \\n\\nWith the financial support of many people in the farming and wine industry, won with 54.1% of the vote, a margin of about 2,500 votes. \\n\\nHopkins will be the first woman to represent the Fifth District on the Board of Supervisors. The board will be majority-female for the first time in history. \\n\\nHopkins will gain the seat and replace Efren Carrillo. \\n\\nSonoma County is the sixth California county to ban GMOs, joining Santa Cruz, Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, and Marin. \\n\\nThis is a big win for anti-GMO advocates because Sonoma County connects Marin County to Mendocino, Humboldt, and Trinity. This means that the ban creates a 13,734-square foot zone where genetically engineered plants cannot be grown. This is the largest such area in the United States. \\n\\nThis is a major victory for a movement that has seen mixed results in local and nation-wide efforts to ban GMO crops in other states. Several counties in Hawaii have passed GMO bans that have been overturned by federal judges. There have been many examples of this happening throughout the United States. In 20114, a ban in Josephine County, Oregon was found invalid because it conflicted with state law. Yet a ban in Jackson County, Oregon remains in force because Jackson was exempted from the aforementioned state law. \\n\\nAccording to Hudson, farmers who are now growing GMOs will be able to continue growing for the current season as a grace period until the ban begins. If a farm already purchased seed for the following year, he or she will be allowed to plant that year as well. \\n\\nYet Tuesday night did not bring victory for all measures. In Healdsburg, Measure T, a ballot measure to eliminate water fluoridation, secured only 41% of the vote. \\n\\nThis was the second time in two years that the people of Healdsburg were rejected a fluoride ban. \\n\\nWhile the water in Healdsburg is fluoridated, the rest of Sonoma County\\u2019s water is not. \\n\\nAs people become increasingly aware about the health risks of eating GMO food, more and more counties are fighting to ban GMO cultivation on their farmland. GMO plants are known to cross-pollinate with non-GMO plants, putting farmers at risk of losing crop and money. This ban is a step in the right direction for the protection of farmers and consumers alike. \\n\\n \",\n          \"CNN anchor Anderson Cooper says he regrets making a \\u201ccrude\\u201d and \\u201cunprofessional\\u201d remark about President Donald Trump to Jeffrey Lord live   Friday during a segment on AC360.

Ms. Stepien, an elementary schoolteacher, said in an interview on Monday, as she was about to board a plane for her honeymoon. \\u201cAnd I was just thinking, \\u2018My dad is here with us, and this man is here with us because of us.\\u2019 \\u201d This story began in September 2006, when her father, Michael Stepien, was walking home from his job as head chef at a restaurant. Mr. Stepien, 53, was cutting through an alley when he was robbed at gunpoint by a    who shot him in the head at close range, she said. Leslie L. Brown was convicted of   murder in the killing and is serving 40 years to life in prison, according to news reports. As her father lay dying at a hospital, Ms. Stepien said, her family \\u201cdecided to accept the inevitable\\u201d and donated his organs through an organization called the Center for Organ Recovery and Education. The organization allows donor families and the recipients to keep in touch with one another after the transplant. Mr. Stepien\\u2019s heart went to Arthur Thomas, a father of four who lives in Lawrenceville, N. J. and who Ms. Stepien said had been within days of dying. Given a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia about 16 years before receiving the transplant, Mr. Thomas, 72, said in an interview on Monday that he was in congestive heart failure when word arrived that his doctors had found a heart. \\u201cIn order to get to the top of the transplant list, you have to be really hurting,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cOnce I had my transplant, I, of course, decided I would write a   to the family. \\u201d From there, a relationship was forged through monthly phone calls, emails and letters. Ms. Stepien\\u2019s mother, Bernice, kept in touch with Mr. Thomas, even swapping cards on Christmas and flowers on birthdays. At times, they compared parenting tips. But the families had not thought about meeting in person until Jeni Stepien, 33, became engaged to Paul Maenner, a    engineer, in October. \\u201cOne of my first thoughts in that following week was, \\u2018Who will walk me down the aisle?\\u2019 \\u201d Ms. Stepien said. \\u201cI was thinking, \\u2018Oh, my gosh, it would be so incredible to have a physical piece of my father there.\\u2019 \\u201d At her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s suggestion, Ms. Stepien wrote Mr. Thomas, whom the family calls Tom, asking him to walk her down the aisle. Mr. Thomas said yes, but only after running the proposition by his    daughter, Jackie, he said. \\u201cShe said, \\u2018I think it\\u2019s a wonderful idea,\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Thomas said of his daughter, who also recommended that he start practicing walking down the aisle. (He said he practiced once before the wedding.) Mr. Thomas, a retired college adviser who formerly worked at a boarding school in Lawrenceville, warned Ms. Stepien that his emotions might get the best of him. Ms. Stepien said she felt the same, and told him, \\u201cI\\u2019ll be right there with you. \\u201d The wedding took place on Saturday in the church in Swissvale where Ms. Stepien\\u2019s parents were married. Mr. Thomas and the bride formally met one day earlier, when he suggested she grip his wrist, where his pulse is strongest. \\u201cI thought that would be the best way for her to feel close to her dad,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s her father\\u2019s heart beating. \\u201d At the church, the bride was photographed touching Mr. Thomas\\u2019s chest. At the reception, they danced together, and guests mingled with Mr. Thomas and his wife, Nancy. The two families say they want to keep in touch and will plan a   somewhere down the road  \\u2014   maybe an event with a little less pressure. \\u201cI felt wonderful about bringing her dad\\u2019s heart to Pittsburgh,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cIf I had to, I would\\u2019ve walked. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4953954815924323,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The future and sustainability of Sonoma County agriculture was also at hand during the contest race between organic farmer Linda Hopkins and former state Senator Noreen Evans for the District Five Board of Supervisors seat. \\n\\nWith the financial support of many people in the farming and wine industry, won with 54.1% of the vote, a margin of about 2,500 votes. \\n\\nHopkins will be the first woman to represent the Fifth District on the Board of Supervisors. The board will be majority-female for the first time in history. \\n\\nHopkins will gain the seat and replace Efren Carrillo. \\n\\nSonoma County is the sixth California county to ban GMOs, joining Santa Cruz, Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, and Marin. \\n\\nThis is a big win for anti-GMO advocates because Sonoma County connects Marin County to Mendocino, Humboldt, and Trinity. This means that the ban creates a 13,734-square foot zone where genetically engineered plants cannot be grown. This is the largest such area in the United States. \\n\\nThis is a major victory for a movement that has seen mixed results in local and nation-wide efforts to ban GMO crops in other states. Several counties in Hawaii have passed GMO bans that have been overturned by federal judges. There have been many examples of this happening throughout the United States. In 20114, a ban in Josephine County, Oregon was found invalid because it conflicted with state law. Yet a ban in Jackson County, Oregon remains in force because Jackson was exempted from the aforementioned state law. \\n\\nAccording to Hudson, farmers who are now growing GMOs will be able to continue growing for the current season as a grace period until the ban begins. If a farm already purchased seed for the following year, he or she will be allowed to plant that year as well. \\n\\nYet Tuesday night did not bring victory for all measures. In Healdsburg, Measure T, a ballot measure to eliminate water fluoridation, secured only 41% of the vote. \\n\\nThis was the second time in two years that the people of Healdsburg were rejected a fluoride ban. \\n\\nWhile the water in Healdsburg is fluoridated, the rest of Sonoma County\\u2019s water is not. \\n\\nAs people become increasingly aware about the health risks of eating GMO food, more and more counties are fighting to ban GMO cultivation on their farmland. GMO plants are known to cross-pollinate with non-GMO plants, putting farmers at risk of losing crop and money. This ban is a step in the right direction for the protection of farmers and consumers alike. \\n\\n \",\n          \"CNN anchor Anderson Cooper says he regrets making a \\u201ccrude\\u201d and \\u201cunprofessional\\u201d remark about President Donald Trump to Jeffrey Lord live   Friday during a segment on AC360.

Ms. Stepien, an elementary schoolteacher, said in an interview on Monday, as she was about to board a plane for her honeymoon. \\u201cAnd I was just thinking, \\u2018My dad is here with us, and this man is here with us because of us.\\u2019 \\u201d This story began in September 2006, when her father, Michael Stepien, was walking home from his job as head chef at a restaurant. Mr. Stepien, 53, was cutting through an alley when he was robbed at gunpoint by a    who shot him in the head at close range, she said. Leslie L. Brown was convicted of   murder in the killing and is serving 40 years to life in prison, according to news reports. As her father lay dying at a hospital, Ms. Stepien said, her family \\u201cdecided to accept the inevitable\\u201d and donated his organs through an organization called the Center for Organ Recovery and Education. The organization allows donor families and the recipients to keep in touch with one another after the transplant. Mr. Stepien\\u2019s heart went to Arthur Thomas, a father of four who lives in Lawrenceville, N. J. and who Ms. Stepien said had been within days of dying. Given a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia about 16 years before receiving the transplant, Mr. Thomas, 72, said in an interview on Monday that he was in congestive heart failure when word arrived that his doctors had found a heart. \\u201cIn order to get to the top of the transplant list, you have to be really hurting,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cOnce I had my transplant, I, of course, decided I would write a   to the family. \\u201d From there, a relationship was forged through monthly phone calls, emails and letters. Ms. Stepien\\u2019s mother, Bernice, kept in touch with Mr. Thomas, even swapping cards on Christmas and flowers on birthdays. At times, they compared parenting tips. But the families had not thought about meeting in person until Jeni Stepien, 33, became engaged to Paul Maenner, a    engineer, in October. \\u201cOne of my first thoughts in that following week was, \\u2018Who will walk me down the aisle?\\u2019 \\u201d Ms. Stepien said. \\u201cI was thinking, \\u2018Oh, my gosh, it would be so incredible to have a physical piece of my father there.\\u2019 \\u201d At her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s suggestion, Ms. Stepien wrote Mr. Thomas, whom the family calls Tom, asking him to walk her down the aisle. Mr. Thomas said yes, but only after running the proposition by his    daughter, Jackie, he said. \\u201cShe said, \\u2018I think it\\u2019s a wonderful idea,\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Thomas said of his daughter, who also recommended that he start practicing walking down the aisle. (He said he practiced once before the wedding.) Mr. Thomas, a retired college adviser who formerly worked at a boarding school in Lawrenceville, warned Ms. Stepien that his emotions might get the best of him. Ms. Stepien said she felt the same, and told him, \\u201cI\\u2019ll be right there with you. \\u201d The wedding took place on Saturday in the church in Swissvale where Ms. Stepien\\u2019s parents were married. Mr. Thomas and the bride formally met one day earlier, when he suggested she grip his wrist, where his pulse is strongest. \\u201cI thought that would be the best way for her to feel close to her dad,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s her father\\u2019s heart beating. \\u201d At the church, the bride was photographed touching Mr. Thomas\\u2019s chest. At the reception, they danced together, and guests mingled with Mr. Thomas and his wife, Nancy. The two families say they want to keep in touch and will plan a   somewhere down the road  \\u2014   maybe an event with a little less pressure. \\u201cI felt wonderful about bringing her dad\\u2019s heart to Pittsburgh,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cIf I had to, I would\\u2019ve walked. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The future and sustainability of Sonoma County agriculture was also at hand during the contest race between organic farmer Linda Hopkins and former state Senator Noreen Evans for the District Five Board of Supervisors seat. \\n\\nWith the financial support of many people in the farming and wine industry, won with 54.1% of the vote, a margin of about 2,500 votes. \\n\\nHopkins will be the first woman to represent the Fifth District on the Board of Supervisors. The board will be majority-female for the first time in history. \\n\\nHopkins will gain the seat and replace Efren Carrillo. \\n\\nSonoma County is the sixth California county to ban GMOs, joining Santa Cruz, Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, and Marin. \\n\\nThis is a big win for anti-GMO advocates because Sonoma County connects Marin County to Mendocino, Humboldt, and Trinity. This means that the ban creates a 13,734-square foot zone where genetically engineered plants cannot be grown. This is the largest such area in the United States. \\n\\nThis is a major victory for a movement that has seen mixed results in local and nation-wide efforts to ban GMO crops in other states. Several counties in Hawaii have passed GMO bans that have been overturned by federal judges. There have been many examples of this happening throughout the United States. In 20114, a ban in Josephine County, Oregon was found invalid because it conflicted with state law. Yet a ban in Jackson County, Oregon remains in force because Jackson was exempted from the aforementioned state law. \\n\\nAccording to Hudson, farmers who are now growing GMOs will be able to continue growing for the current season as a grace period until the ban begins. If a farm already purchased seed for the following year, he or she will be allowed to plant that year as well. \\n\\nYet Tuesday night did not bring victory for all measures. In Healdsburg, Measure T, a ballot measure to eliminate water fluoridation, secured only 41% of the vote. \\n\\nThis was the second time in two years that the people of Healdsburg were rejected a fluoride ban. \\n\\nWhile the water in Healdsburg is fluoridated, the rest of Sonoma County\\u2019s water is not. \\n\\nAs people become increasingly aware about the health risks of eating GMO food, more and more counties are fighting to ban GMO cultivation on their farmland. GMO plants are known to cross-pollinate with non-GMO plants, putting farmers at risk of losing crop and money. This ban is a step in the right direction for the protection of farmers and consumers alike. \\n\\n \",\n          \"CNN anchor Anderson Cooper says he regrets making a \\u201ccrude\\u201d and \\u201cunprofessional\\u201d remark about President Donald Trump to Jeffrey Lord live   Friday during a segment on AC360.

Ms. Stepien, an elementary schoolteacher, said in an interview on Monday, as she was about to board a plane for her honeymoon. \\u201cAnd I was just thinking, \\u2018My dad is here with us, and this man is here with us because of us.\\u2019 \\u201d This story began in September 2006, when her father, Michael Stepien, was walking home from his job as head chef at a restaurant. Mr. Stepien, 53, was cutting through an alley when he was robbed at gunpoint by a    who shot him in the head at close range, she said. Leslie L. Brown was convicted of   murder in the killing and is serving 40 years to life in prison, according to news reports. As her father lay dying at a hospital, Ms. Stepien said, her family \\u201cdecided to accept the inevitable\\u201d and donated his organs through an organization called the Center for Organ Recovery and Education. The organization allows donor families and the recipients to keep in touch with one another after the transplant. Mr. Stepien\\u2019s heart went to Arthur Thomas, a father of four who lives in Lawrenceville, N. J. and who Ms. Stepien said had been within days of dying. Given a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia about 16 years before receiving the transplant, Mr. Thomas, 72, said in an interview on Monday that he was in congestive heart failure when word arrived that his doctors had found a heart. \\u201cIn order to get to the top of the transplant list, you have to be really hurting,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cOnce I had my transplant, I, of course, decided I would write a   to the family. \\u201d From there, a relationship was forged through monthly phone calls, emails and letters. Ms. Stepien\\u2019s mother, Bernice, kept in touch with Mr. Thomas, even swapping cards on Christmas and flowers on birthdays. At times, they compared parenting tips. But the families had not thought about meeting in person until Jeni Stepien, 33, became engaged to Paul Maenner, a    engineer, in October. \\u201cOne of my first thoughts in that following week was, \\u2018Who will walk me down the aisle?\\u2019 \\u201d Ms. Stepien said. \\u201cI was thinking, \\u2018Oh, my gosh, it would be so incredible to have a physical piece of my father there.\\u2019 \\u201d At her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s suggestion, Ms. Stepien wrote Mr. Thomas, whom the family calls Tom, asking him to walk her down the aisle. Mr. Thomas said yes, but only after running the proposition by his    daughter, Jackie, he said. \\u201cShe said, \\u2018I think it\\u2019s a wonderful idea,\\u2019 \\u201d Mr. Thomas said of his daughter, who also recommended that he start practicing walking down the aisle. (He said he practiced once before the wedding.) Mr. Thomas, a retired college adviser who formerly worked at a boarding school in Lawrenceville, warned Ms. Stepien that his emotions might get the best of him. Ms. Stepien said she felt the same, and told him, \\u201cI\\u2019ll be right there with you. \\u201d The wedding took place on Saturday in the church in Swissvale where Ms. Stepien\\u2019s parents were married. Mr. Thomas and the bride formally met one day earlier, when he suggested she grip his wrist, where his pulse is strongest. \\u201cI thought that would be the best way for her to feel close to her dad,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s her father\\u2019s heart beating. \\u201d At the church, the bride was photographed touching Mr. Thomas\\u2019s chest. At the reception, they danced together, and guests mingled with Mr. Thomas and his wife, Nancy. The two families say they want to keep in touch and will plan a   somewhere down the road  \\u2014   maybe an event with a little less pressure. \\u201cI felt wonderful about bringing her dad\\u2019s heart to Pittsburgh,\\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \\u201cIf I had to, I would\\u2019ve walked. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
