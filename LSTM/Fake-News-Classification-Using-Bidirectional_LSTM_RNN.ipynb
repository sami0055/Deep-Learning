If Hillary had prevailed, the roadmap would have been a grim one, as all of our work would have had to take place underground. Happily, we will be able to work in the open. Here are three ways that we can leverage Trump\\u2019s victory to bring back the patriarchy.\\nRule yourself Bruce Wayne is a good role model for traditional men: Urbane, fit, financially independent\\u2014and dangerous.\\nThis may seem obvious, but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy, we have to be men who are worthy of it. A patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown. However, a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it. Thus, the first step in making progress under a Trump administration is the same as it would have been if Hillary had been elected\\u2014self-improvement.\\nSelf-improvement involves the obvious things: getting in shape, training martial arts, getting rid of addictions, and exercising self-discipline. The process of self-improvement needs to be under-girded with a philosophy of life. For most men, this will involve adopting, and faithfully living, one of the faith-traditions. For others, it may mean adopting stoic philosophy. Whatever it is, it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate, \\u201cpleasure, wealth, and power at any cost\\u201d morality of our Spirit Cooking elites\\u2014lack of morality got us into this problem in the first place.\\nSelf-improvement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence. Under a Trump administration, this last goal will become easier to achieve. Trump\\u2019s tax plan cuts tax rates across the board. This will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income. They will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy.\\nTrump\\u2019s emphasis on fair trade will also result in more American jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity. The age of Trump will be a great time to start a new business. One word of warning is in order though: Under Trump the US is likely to flourish in a way that hasn\\u2019t happened since the the 1920s. Enjoy the prosperity but don\\u2019t get caught back in the materialism merry-go-round. Our goal is a lifetime of financial independence, not conspicuous consumption.\\nFinancial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step, which is ruling your family.\\nRule your family Be the patriarch.\\nStarting with the boomers, our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism. Families got smaller, divorce became more common, promiscuity increased, feminism became the default philosophy for girls, and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished. Progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism.\\nA Trump administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family. At best, the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it. But real change has to come from the bottom up\\u2014from men and women who return to tradition. For us, that means finding a traditional woman, or more likely one who can be converted to tradition, getting married, and having lots of children. A Twitter shitlord ( @johnrandom1234 ) drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a four-step \\u201cTrump Bump\\u201d starter kit:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting married, having children, and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game, but it is the only way we will have long term victory. Without a next generation of traditional men, any ground that we gain under Trump will soon be lost.\\nRule society\\u2014bring back the patriarchy Benjamin Franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty.\\nThe next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions. Trump has captured the presidency and Republicans control Congress, but many of those Republicans are cucks who will oppose the Trumpian agenda. And our other institutions are still dominated by leftists. Hollywood, the news media, education, and corporations all proclaim the progressive, anti-patriarchy message. If we don\\u2019t take advantage of the current moment, any gains that Trump makes will be quickly rolled-back after he leaves office.\\nTherefore, we need to start re-engaging with these institutions to shift them towards Patriarchal Nationalism . You can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments. Here, I\\u2019d like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation: the Republican Party. Trump has created many allies within the GOP but the majority of the Party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like NAFTA. The GOP desperately needs like-minded men within its ranks who will help Trump achieve his vision.\\nGetting involved in your local GOP is easy. You merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district. You don\\u2019t have to run for elected office. Simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected, voting for delegates, or attending GOP events. Go in with a respectful attitude. A lot of the local GOP leaders are good people who still don\\u2019t understand that the real battle is against globalists. Work for incremental change. And, if you have the disposition required for it, consider running for local office yourself.\\nOne piece of advice: If you do choose to get involved in politics, don\\u2019t get caught up in it. One way we ended up with an ossified and out-of-touch GOP is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor. The other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of Hillary Clinton. If you do choose to enter the political realm, resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain. Don\\u2019t make politics your life. Think of it strictly as civic duty.\\nOf course, politics is not everybody\\u2019s cup of tea. The key is to use your gifts, whether that is in movie-making or in running a company, to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish.\\nConclusion The one thing we must not do in wake of the Trump victory is rest on our laurels. If Hillary had won, we\\u2019d all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life. Now that Trump is coming into power, the temptation is to relax\\u2014to just let Trump do it all. This temptation must be avoided. We must capitalize on the Trump victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a Hillary victory. If we don\\u2019t, we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained.\\nRead More: How Donald Trump Vanquished His Enemies And Conquered The Republican Party \\n\",\n          \"Leave a reply \\u201cLove Sun & Mother Earth\\u201d \\u2013 photographer Makiko \\nJuliet Tang \\u2013 Prior to birth, just like an artist who is selecting which paints will go onto the blank canvas, our souls choose a set of colors to work with which determine our parents, ethnicity, country of birth, etc. We also choose a number of possible paths that would allow us to experience certain aspects of our being. For instance, if courage is one of those aspects of ourselves we wish to experience, we would collaborate with other souls in this physical realm so circumstances would arise in our lives where we are required to invoke courage within us. Likewise, we choose a certain mission, or a calling that would allow us to maximize our full potentials on this live stage called earth. \\nIn order to fully step into our calling with power and consciousness, we must first elect to forget what it is at birth so we may, after years and decades, and for some, lifetimes of soul searching, arrive at a point in our lives where we must make a choice to remember who we truly are and deliberately call forth what gives us highest joy. \\nPersonally, I see the long years of painful searching as nothing more than a rite of passage with intended experiences and divinely placed circumstances that fully prepares us to be who we came here to be. The second we reunite with our soul\\u2019s calling, the universe registers our seriousness and we come to the realization that nothing can and will stand in our way. \\nAt that moment, all fears and obstacles begin fading as the path unfolds in front of us. At that moment, we will move mountains and cross oceans just so that we can become one with our highest intention and commit to our divine mission. At that moment, our body, mind and soul become aligned with one single purpose \\u2013 to experience ourselves as our own grandest creation in this life. \\nFunny enough, once we remember our mission, we often realize the mission has very little to do with us and everything to do with everyone else. It is a mission that allows us to serve humanity and to light the paths for others through servicing, healing, inspiring, teaching and empowering. \\nIt is no coincidence that for many, in order to remember that mission, we must first experience the pains and turmoil in life so we may later not only decide to transcend what limits us, but also use our life journey as a tool to inspire and encourage others to do the same. Some of the most influential teachers from Hay House such as Louise Hay, Anita Moorjani and the late Wayne Dyer are but a few who had journeyed to the darkness and back so they may light the way for others. \\nKnow that wherever you are in life is exactly where you need to be . You are not bound to any fate and you have the power to change and create anything in life. It is my hope that by sharing the following 3 reminders that are embedded in your soul blueprint, you will begin manifesting your calling. You came here with something to do. You are part of a universal consciousness, and there are no accidents in it. In your true essence\\u2014not the false self, not the ego part of you, but in the true essence of who you are\\u2014you are infinite and you have something very profound to accomplish while you\\u2019re here. Otherwise you wouldn\\u2019t be here. Find it. Pay attention to it. Listen to the callings. See the clues, the cues. See the alignments, whatever they might be, no matter how absurd or bizarre they might seem to everyone around you\\u2026if you have a calling inside that says there\\u2019s also something else, don\\u2019t ignore that. Don\\u2019t die with your music still in you. Don\\u2019t die with your purpose unfulfilled. Don\\u2019t die feeling as if your life has been wrong. Don\\u2019t let that happen to you. ~ Wayne Dyer Identify Your Highest Joy \\nAs beings of energy, we ourselves are literally the creation tools we are born with and our feeling is the direct line of communication with our soul, or the higher self. At any time when our thoughts, words and actions are aligned with the soul\\u2019s vision, we know it immediately by the way we feel which is usually identified as harmony, inner-peace, joy, gratitude and love. \\nWhenever we feel good, our vibration is instantly higher which easily leads to inspired action; and by committing ourselves to inspired action, it leads to more joy which expands the breeding ground of inspired action. The more we can get in touch with the \\u201cfeel good\\u201d component within ourselves and listen to it, the easier it will be for us to define our mission in life. \\nFor the longest time, I had not a clue what my calling was and I spent the majority of my time complaining and wishing I could do something else with my life while holding onto the belief that a job and a passion are mutually exclusive. I did have many passions and since I felt miserable with my job, I indulged myself with activities I enjoyed whenever I had free time. Being a spiritual seeker since birth, one of my passions was alternative healing. For many years, I heard and read about Reiki and there was always that little voice in the back of my head whispering, \\u201cTake a Reiki class.\\u201d Like many, I brushed aside the little voice with as many excuses as I could find but eventually, the voice became so persistent that I decided to just go for it. \\nAs someone who was also obsessed with doing the due diligence for everything I stepped into, I spent hours researching for an experienced teacher. I already signed up for a course elsewhere when the name of my first Reiki teacher popped up in my search, and for reasons unknown to me at the time, I made a last minute decision to go with this class. \\nDuring the two days of training, I met someone whom I became friends with. Fast forward to years later, we currently share an office space doing healing work in Midtown Manhattan. Within the same year after the initial training, the same friend introduced me to another Reiki teacher who is the very reason why I eventually became a recovery and wellness coach as well as Reiki master. During those years, every time when I was guided by inspiration , life rewarded me with more people, events and circumstances that helped me remember my true essence and carry out my mission. \\nDo not despair if you do not yet remember what you came here to be. Your only duty in this life is to follow your highest joy. Believe me, it is much more than just a clich\\u00e9 line that we use as a bumper sticker. \\nOnce we follow the first inspired idea, we are sending out the energy with the intention of \\u201cI am my highest joy at this given moment\\u201d into the universe which slowly intensifies and magnifies as we become more accustomed to singing our heart\\u2019s song. What has started as a seed is given more opportunities to grow and flourish every time when we follow our highest feelings because the energy behind that intention is literally snowballing and creating more and more movement in the quantum field in bringing us what make us happy. \\nWhat inspires you? What makes your heart sing? What\\u2019s that one thing you\\u2019ve been wanting to do but have been putting off forever? \\nIt\\u2019s time. Allow Your Being to Guide Your Doing \\nOne of the most frustrating things we do to ourselves is we get stuck envisioning the million tasks we must do to accomplish anything, that can also be the very thing that keeps us from moving forward. \\nAnswering our calling is very much a process like everything else. The end result may look nothing like what we started off with or what we planned, and that is completely ok. Sometimes what we think we want only serves as a stepping stone that leads us closer to fulfilling our mission. The universe does not care about what we do that makes us radiate with joy, it can be taking a Reiki class or a baking class, going on that spontaneous vacation or calling an old friend we haven\\u2019t seen for years. The universe only cares about the vibrational signature we give off when we are being that joy. \\nBy giving ourselves into inspired action, we may be meeting a teacher for life who becomes our source of inspiration, or be welcoming an opportunity that otherwise would not be there had we not chosen to follow our heart and arrive at that exact location and time. \\nThe only decision we have to make on a daily basis is to start following whichever things that give us whatever amount of joy out of all the available daily activities in front of us rather than coming up with a huge plan of action to get ourselves from point A to B because \\u201cit is the right thing to do\\u201d or \\u201c everyone else does it .\\u201d \\nIf your only daily activities are comprised of chores such as house cleaning, meeting deadlines and cooking for a family of six, then invite yourself to do some (or all) of those things with as much joy and presence as you can , and to squeeze in a couple of little activities that bring you peace and make you come alive. They can be as simple as having quiet time to read for 15 minutes or working on that hobby when everyone goes to sleep. You just never know what may come out of them! \\nDo not ever underestimate the power behind these little activities as they are what make the energy accumulate. Remember, it is always about being the \\u201cI am my highest joy at this given moment\\u201d energy rather than flooding ourselves with tasks and running around aimlessly for the simple reason that we cannot find our calling outside of ourselves, but we can remember or create it within us. The more we can allow that energy to flow to us and from us, the more the universe can bring us everything that resonates on the same energy level to help us remember and create our destinies. \\nIs the path of committing ourselves to remembering, and eventually embodying our calling always peachy? The answer is no. It is a journey that is made of a thousand little steps of learning and choosing. Along the way of building my healing practice, I was constantly discouraged by my lack of knowledge and tools to run a business as well as overwhelmed by the millions of tasks I was constantly bombarded with. \\nI invested a great deal of energy on training courses from learning how to write my about page to polishing up the content of my website so I can reach a larger audience. No matter how much I tried to tweak my writing while working with business coaches and alike, I was unable to meet their standards of using \\u201csimple and client friendly\\u201d language where I could explain what I do in a couple of sentences to an eight-year old. \\nOne day, exactly one year from the day I resigned from my last job, it finally hit me. While I will always remain grateful of the knowledge and support I have taken away from the courses, my writing reflects my true essence, and who I am at the core is someone who thinks, feels and speaks like the spiritual geek that I am proud to be. By giving myself endless tasks of to-do\\u2019s that do not align with my inspired actions, I am neglecting who I came here to be \\u2013 someone who helps others heal, awaken and create through spiritual writing, healing and coaching. \\nIn fact, this article was entirely inspired by hours of staring at weeks worth of unfinished homework documents from my latest course with the sudden realization that the content of my website may never appeal to everyone, and that is perfectly ok. I was faced with two choices, to continue doing the daunting task of sounding like someone I am not, or being immersed in the joy of writing. The moment I chose the latter, a stream of inspiration poured in and gave birth to these words. \\nAt the end of the day, it isn\\u2019t about what we do, how we do it, what our titles are, how polished our website looks, how many credentials are displayed in our bios and how many award-winning books we\\u2019ve published. It is about whether we can allow ourselves to step into who we truly are, and boldly and lovingly declare our authenticity to the world. No vibration in the universe is more powerful than our energy when it becomes an extension of our divine calling. \\nWhat are some things on your daily to-do list? Which ones of those give you any amount of joy? How can you insert more \\u201cfeel good\\u201d activities into your life? How can you replace the aimless \\u201cto-do\\u2019s\\u201d with more inspired action? Your Calling is Your Own Creation \\nOur souls have chosen a certain mission prior to birth, but the moment we become fully conscious of who we are and awaken to the creator within, we are no longer bound to any predetermined paths we laid out for ourselves before coming into this physical body. The more we are aware of our true essence and our connection with the divine source , the more empowered we become and the more we can claim the gift of free will which ultimately allows us to exercise our birthright as the conscious creator to Be, Do, and Have anything our soul desires. \\nTo achieve that, we must first free ourselves from everything that limits us. Limitations can take the form of fear such as fear of uncertainty/change, fear of lack, or even fear of success. Limitations can also manifest as endless excuses ranging from \\u201cI have a full time job with no time or money\\u201d to \\u201cI\\u2019m too old to do this.\\u201d In addition, limitations show up as disempowering beliefs including, \\u201cThere isn\\u2019t enough for everyone\\u201d or \\u201cI am not special enough.\\u201d \\nThere is no one way to initiate that journey of liberation, there is only what works for you. Personally, I\\u2019ve found spiritual practices such as energy healing, Kundalini yoga, meditation, working with a spiritual coach, being in nature, journaling and reading inspirational books are all great ways to awaken. \\nI used to be the queen of \\u201cwhat-if\\u2019s.\\u201d \\u201cWhat if I failed?\\u201d \\u201cWhat if I lost it all?\\u201d \\u201cWhat if I became a laughingstock?\\u201d One day, I grew sick of my negative what-if\\u2019s and decided to do a 180. \\u201cWhat if I succeeded?\\u201d \\u201cWhat if I learned something from this?\\u201d \\u201cWhat if I could help others?\\u201d I made a point to do this every day for months and it made a remarkable difference in my ability to exercise my free will. \\nPrior to tapping into our true creator role, many of us feel like powerless victims who take whatever life throws at us. We may be passionate about answering our calling as an artist but end up working at a bank because we are afraid we won\\u2019t make ends meet. We feel limited, even enslaved by the conditions in our lives. We submit ourselves to our so-called fate and tell stories of how we aren\\u2019t fortunate enough to be one of those who seem to have it all . \\nWhen we awaken, we become aware that we are who we say we are, and what we create as well as how we wish to experience everything in life depends on one thing and one thing only \\u2013 our choice. \\nYour calling is something you soul chose in the realm of the formless before it took on a body, and you can choose again at any time in this life because the truth is, your soul remains who you truly are while your body and mind are only additional tools for you to carry out your mission so you may experience your own creations physically in this 3D time and space dimension. That power of choice has never left you. Once you decide, allow the universe to bring you the rest of the co-creators to make it happen. \\nIt is time to unleash your free will and write your own destiny. There is nothing written in the stars that are foreshadowing who you are and what you can become. Once every part and every cell within you is aligned with this inner-knowing, you have awakened to the divine power of creation you have inherited. That power lives in you and patiently awaits for you to call upon it. \\nYou are neither your past, your birth conditions, your roles, your accomplishments, your credentials, your awards, your bills, your bank statements, your 9-5 job that makes you cringe every morning upon waking up, nor are you your body, your mind, your beliefs, your thoughts, your baggage, your limitations, your past relationships, even your soul contract. Deep down inside, you are a being powerful beyond your imagination. Once you remember all this, you will remember your sacred ability to create anything you wish and your joyous vibration will make the world just a little brighter. \\nIt matters not one bit if you do not know your calling. If you could start from a blank slate and create anything you wanted in life without limitations from this moment on, who would you be? What would you create? \\nWhat is one small step you can take today to be that? \\nFollow your heart. \\nJuliet Tang is a Usui/Holy Fire Reiki Master, certified hypnotist and founder of Jewel\\u2019s Healing Garden , a holistic practice in New York that combines energy healing, hypnosis and intuitive coaching to help others achieve healing and personal transformation.

While the Pentagon\\u2019s public goal has duly sought to wrest control from Assad and fight the Islamic State, the CIA program of arming rebels is widely considered counterproductive \\u2014 if not, perhaps, nefarious.\\nPlan B, despite potentially devastating repercussions, retains stolid support from top officials, including unsurprisingly CIA Director John Brennan and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter \\u2014 but has lost favor recently with former proponents, including Secretary of State John Kerry.\\nKerry and other skeptics rightly grasp providing heavy artillery to rebels fighting Russia-backed Syrian government forces to down Russian aircraft \\u2014 which would undoubtedly turn the smoldering U.S. proxy battle into an all-out war with Russia.\\nAdditionally, the Post reports, a growing number of U.S. officials feel the contentious CIA program has only proven to bedevil the ultimate goal of regime change, and, as one unnamed \\u2018senior official\\u2019 noted, CIA units are \\u201cnot doing any better on the battlefield, they\\u2019re up against a more formidable adversary, and they\\u2019re increasingly dominated by extremists,\\u201d adding, \\u201cWhat has this program become, and how will history record this effort?\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5000183914571291,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

On that day, the distance between our planet and the moon will be the shortest in almost 70 years! The last time it happened was in January 1948. \\nEarth\\u2019s natural satellite will appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter in comparison with an average full moon. It is estimated that the next supermoon of this size will take place on 25 November 2034 , so make sure you don\\u2019t miss this beautiful celestial event (if the weather conditions in your region are favorable for skywatching, of course)! \\nAs NASA reports: \\n\\u201cThe full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21 st century. The full moon won\\u2019t come this close to Earth again until 25 November 2034.\\u201d What Is a Supermoon \\nAlmost all celestial bodies have elliptical orbits; that\\u2019s why the distance between our planet and the moon is not always the same. The further side of the moon\\u2019s orbit is called apogee and the closer one is called perigee. In short, when a full moon occurs on the perigee, then we get a supermoon phenomenon , which causes our natural satellite to appear closer and brighter in the night sky. \\nWhile supermoons are quite frequent (this year, we will have three of those), the full moon of November 14 will be within approximately 2 hours of perigee , which makes it a truly rare phenomenon. How to Watch a Supermoon \\nA perfect location to enjoy the coming supermoon (as well as any other astronomical phenomenon) is somewhere away from the city so that the urban lights don\\u2019t interfere with skywatching. \\nDon\\u2019t forget that the difference between a regular full moon and a supermoon is best seen to the human eye when the moon is close to the horizon. \\nAccording to NASA, \\u201c When the moon is near the horizon, it can look unnaturally large when viewed through trees, buildings, or other foreground objects.\\u201d \\nThe moon will be at the peak of its full phase and, therefore, will appear the biggest at 8:52am EST. For those of you living in Australia, the moon will reach its full phase at 12:52 a.m. AEST on November 15.

This year, they will be one more sign of wacky and warming weather. The National Park Service, which maintains the trees, said on Wednesday that the pink and white blossoms could reach their peak as soon as March 14, a full three weeks earlier than normal. If the flowers indeed pop on that date, it will be the earliest bloom on record. That is thanks to springlike weather that has made a roaring early advance across much of the United States in recent weeks, breaking records from New England to the Deep South and punctuating a mild winter. In Texas, which experienced temperatures in the high 80s on several days in February, flowers and trees are in bloom well ahead of schedule. Chicago has had only dustings of snow so far this year  \\u2014   far below the 9. 1 inches expected in February. And in New York State, maple syrup producers started tapping their trees two months before they normally do. \\u201cThe key thing is it\\u2019s not just the East Coast and the blooming of cherry blossoms,\\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \\u201cThis is going on all over the world. \\u201d Here in Washington, the warmth has organizers of the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, a monthlong series of performances and other events, racing to meet the early flowering. Diana Mayhew, the festival\\u2019s president, said officials made the decision on Tuesday to begin five days earlier than planned, on March 15, after representatives from the Park Service briefed them on their forecast. Ms. Mayhew said she expected as many as a million and a half people to take part in the   festival, with many of them crowding the   pathways that line the Tidal Basin from dawn to well past dusk. The cherry trees date to 1912, when Japan gave some 3, 000 of them to the United States as a gesture of friendship. Only a handful of the original trees remain, but thousands more have been planted since. Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said the agency made its annual bloom prediction based on history, natural indicators on the trees and the weather forecast. The trees are considered to be in peak bloom when 70 percent of the basin\\u2019s most common variety, Yoshino, are in flower. In a typical year, that comes on April 4. But not this year. Given the mild winter and rare February warmth, the Park Service says the peak should come between March 14 and 17, depending on the weather in the coming weeks. The record, set in 1990, is March 15. Like much of the central and eastern United States, Washington has seen a winter of record and   warmth. February here was the warmest on record, with average temperatures almost 9 degrees above normal and one degree higher than a normal March. This year may be a partial anomaly, Mr. Litterst said, but the average date of peak bloom has shifted forward by almost five days since record keeping began in 1921. On Thursday, as wind cutting across the Tidal Basin tossed heavy buds through the air, a small group of blossom hunters clustered near a lone, rippling flower that they said they were happy to welcome early. Ryan Cook was delighted to be among them. On a work trip to the capital with his son, Noah, Mr. Cook had been monitoring the blossoms\\u2019 development online in hopes of catching a glimpse before leaving town. As they stopped to take a picture, though, Mr. Cook said he was a bit uneasy with a winter that even at home in Morral, Ohio, has been unusually warm  \\u2014   \\u201cscarily so. \\u201d \\u201cJust the fact that winter isn\\u2019t what it used to be  \\u2014   it just doesn\\u2019t make sense,\\u201d he said, saying it was almost certainly a sign of the changing climate that scientific studies describe. \\u201cI\\u2019ll go with the scientists. \\u201d\",\n          \"BEIRUT, Lebanon  \\u2014   On the day after his 51st birthday, Bashar   the president of Syria, took a victory lap through the dusty streets of a destroyed and empty rebel town that his forces had starved into submission. Smiling, with his shirt open at the collar, he led officials in dark suits past deserted shops and   buildings before telling a reporter that  \\u2014   despite a   announced by the United States and Russia  \\u2014   he was committed \\u201cto taking back all areas from the terrorists. \\u201d When he says terrorists, he means all who oppose him. More than five years into the conflict that has shattered his country, displaced half its population and killed hundreds of thousands of people, Mr. Assad denies any responsibility for the destruction. Instead, he presents himself as a reasonable head of state and the sole unifier who can end the war and reconcile Syria\\u2019s people. That insistence, which he has clung to for years even as his forces hit civilians with gas attacks and barrel bombs, is a major impediment to sustaining a   let alone ending the war. The new   less than a week old, is already tenuous. On Saturday, the United States acknowledged carrying out an airstrike that killed Syrian government troops in eastern Syria. Attacks have resumed across the country, and aid meant for besieged residents of Aleppo, Syria\\u2019s largest city, is still stuck at the Turkish border. Mr. Assad has become a central paradox of the war: He is secure and kept in place by foreign backers as his country splinters, although few see the war ending and Syria being put back together as long as he stays. Although he remains a pariah to the West, and scores of militant groups continue to fight to oust him, even his opponents acknowledge that he has navigated his way out of the immediate threats to his rule, making the question of his fate an intractable dilemma. The rebels are unlikely to stop fighting as long as the man they blame for the majority of the war\\u2019s deaths remains. But fear of what might emerge if Mr. Assad is ousted has deterred many Syrians from joining the insurrection and may have helped prevent countries like the United States from acting more forcefully against him. The result has been a crushing stalemate. Mr. Assad\\u2019s standing as leader of Syria is diminished  \\u2014   and yet stable. \\u201cThe problem is that he cannot win, and at the same time he is not losing,\\u201d said Samir Altaqi, the director of the Orient Research Center in Dubai. \\u201cBut at the end of the day, what is left of Syria? He is still the leader, but he lost the state. \\u201d Indeed, recent events give the impression that Mr. Assad has succeeded in muddling through, without being held accountable. August came and went with little mention of the anniversary of the chemical attacks by his forces that killed more than 1, 000 people in 2013. Turkey, a key backer of the rebels, dropped its demand that he leave power immediately, and the United States has stopped calling for his removal. And the day before Mr. Assad\\u2019s birthday on Sept. 11, for which his supporters created a fawning website, the United States and Russia announced a new   agreement with surprising benefits for Mr. Assad. Besides making no mention of his political future, the agreement brought together one of his greatest foes, the United States, with one of his greatest allies, Russia, to bomb the jihadists who threaten his rule. Years ago, few assumed that Mr. Assad would join the ranks of the world\\u2019s bloodiest dictators.   and educated as an ophthalmologist, he had not planned on a political career but was summoned from London by his father and predecessor, Hafez Assad, when the heir apparent, Bashar\\u2019s elder brother, Bassel, died in a car accident in 1994. After Bashar succeeded his father as president in 2000, many hoped he would reform the country. But those hopes dwindled, evaporating entirely with the start of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, when Mr. Assad sought to quell initially peaceful protests with overwhelming violence. The conflict escalated from there. Despite widespread opposition to his rule, a combination of factors has enabled Mr. Assad to persevere, analysts say. His foes have remained divided and have failed to convince many Syrians, especially religious minorities, that they would protect their rights or run the country better than Mr. Assad. As continuous battles have ground down his forces, Mr. Assad has been the beneficiary of significant military support from Iran, Russia and Lebanon\\u2019s Hezbollah  \\u2014   aid much more significant than what the United States and its allies have given the rebels. And the rise of jihadist organizations like the Islamic State and the   Nusra Front, recently renamed the Levant Conquest Front, have led many Syrians and some of Mr. Assad\\u2019s international opponents to conclude that he is the lesser evil. While he may be brutal to his people, the thinking goes, he does not directly threaten the West. His victory tour on Monday showcased the desolation of the town of Daraya, a longtime rebel stronghold whose remaining residents were bused out last month after an extended siege by government forces. In videos released by the Syrian government, Mr. Assad arrived in town driving his own car, a silver Hyundai fidgeted though a sermon praising him for protecting Syria and performed prayers for the Muslim Eid   holiday. Then, as martial music played, the camera jumped between images of the area\\u2019s destruction and scenes of Mr. Assad leading a determined entourage through town. A reporter stopped him for questions, and Mr. Assad spoke in soft tones about reconciliation and reconstruction. He mocked his foes as \\u201crented revolutionaries,\\u201d a dig at their foreign backing, and laughed at his turn of phrase. His entourage got the cue and laughed as well. For many Syrians, the message was clear. \\u201cHe is a man who wanted to show all Syrians that this would be their luck if they opposed him,\\u201d said Murhaf Jouejati, the chairman of the Day After organization, which aims to prepare Syrians for a democratic future. Malik Rifai, an antigovernment activist from Daraya now displaced to northern Syria, said he felt numb watching Mr. Assad walk the streets of his empty hometown, but shared a video of a flock of birds that had flown over as residents were leaving. He interpreted it as a sign that they would return, he said. \\u201cThose birds were a deep message from heaven, whereas Bashar\\u2019s presence was just a parade, showing the muscles of a weak person,\\u201d Mr. Rifai said in an online chat. Mr. Assad\\u2019s dark suits and calm tones have given him a public image more sophisticated than that of other Arab autocrats like Col. Muammar   of Libya and Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who often brandished weapons and gave thundering speeches, threatening their enemies. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a different kind of bloodthirsty dictator, the kind who shops online on his iPad,\\u201d said Nadim Houry, who oversaw the work of Human Rights Watch on Syria for a decade. \\u201cHe\\u2019s sort of Arab dictator 2. 0. \\u201d Colonel Qaddafi and Mr. Hussein were both killed after foreign interventions aimed at removing them from power  \\u2014   a fate Mr. Assad appears to have escaped, even though the death toll on his watch has exceeded that of his more colorful colleagues. His perseverance has frustrated those who feel Mr. Assad should be held accountable. \\u201cThe fact that many leaders are considering or willing to deal with him today as if he has not gassed his own people or tortured thousands to death is an indictment of the current policy environment across the world,\\u201d Mr. Houry said. \\u201cThere is a level of cynicism, a lack of ambition. \\u201d But analysts note many weaknesses in Mr. Assad\\u2019s position. After years of war, he holds less than half of Syria\\u2019s territory and his forces are depleted, making it hard for them to seize and hold new areas. Military aid from Iran and Hezbollah on the ground and from Russia in the skies has held off rebel advances, but they have also made him more dependent on foreign powers looking out for their own interests. Diplomats who track Syria say that while Iran remains committed to Mr. Assad, the Russians could negotiate him away if their interests were protected. And signs of Russian displeasure with Mr. Assad have occasionally surfaced. In June, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, visited Syria apparently without informing Mr. Assad that he was coming  \\u2014   a major embarrassment for a president who speaks often of national sovereignty. \\u201cA pleasant surprise!\\u201d a beaming Mr. Assad said in a video of the meeting. \\u201cI did not know that you were coming in person. \\u201d But Mr. Assad still has significant support in areas he controls, including among many Syrians who want the war to end and see no alternative to his rule. \\u201cIf God gives him life, I see that he\\u2019ll be president until Syria comes back the way that it was,\\u201d said Bouchra   a Lebanese lawyer who meets regularly with Syrian officials and knows Mr. Assad. She dismissed the idea that the violence of Mr. Assad\\u2019s government would make Syrians reject him after the war. \\u201cPeople love their homeland,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAll that hate and aggression will go away in the end. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.49549494503221914,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

On that day, the distance between our planet and the moon will be the shortest in almost 70 years! The last time it happened was in January 1948. \\nEarth\\u2019s natural satellite will appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter in comparison with an average full moon. It is estimated that the next supermoon of this size will take place on 25 November 2034 , so make sure you don\\u2019t miss this beautiful celestial event (if the weather conditions in your region are favorable for skywatching, of course)! \\nAs NASA reports: \\n\\u201cThe full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21 st century. The full moon won\\u2019t come this close to Earth again until 25 November 2034.\\u201d What Is a Supermoon \\nAlmost all celestial bodies have elliptical orbits; that\\u2019s why the distance between our planet and the moon is not always the same. The further side of the moon\\u2019s orbit is called apogee and the closer one is called perigee. In short, when a full moon occurs on the perigee, then we get a supermoon phenomenon , which causes our natural satellite to appear closer and brighter in the night sky. \\nWhile supermoons are quite frequent (this year, we will have three of those), the full moon of November 14 will be within approximately 2 hours of perigee , which makes it a truly rare phenomenon. How to Watch a Supermoon \\nA perfect location to enjoy the coming supermoon (as well as any other astronomical phenomenon) is somewhere away from the city so that the urban lights don\\u2019t interfere with skywatching. \\nDon\\u2019t forget that the difference between a regular full moon and a supermoon is best seen to the human eye when the moon is close to the horizon. \\nAccording to NASA, \\u201c When the moon is near the horizon, it can look unnaturally large when viewed through trees, buildings, or other foreground objects.\\u201d \\nThe moon will be at the peak of its full phase and, therefore, will appear the biggest at 8:52am EST. For those of you living in Australia, the moon will reach its full phase at 12:52 a.m. AEST on November 15.

This year, they will be one more sign of wacky and warming weather. The National Park Service, which maintains the trees, said on Wednesday that the pink and white blossoms could reach their peak as soon as March 14, a full three weeks earlier than normal. If the flowers indeed pop on that date, it will be the earliest bloom on record. That is thanks to springlike weather that has made a roaring early advance across much of the United States in recent weeks, breaking records from New England to the Deep South and punctuating a mild winter. In Texas, which experienced temperatures in the high 80s on several days in February, flowers and trees are in bloom well ahead of schedule. Chicago has had only dustings of snow so far this year  \\u2014   far below the 9. 1 inches expected in February. And in New York State, maple syrup producers started tapping their trees two months before they normally do. \\u201cThe key thing is it\\u2019s not just the East Coast and the blooming of cherry blossoms,\\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \\u201cThis is going on all over the world. \\u201d Here in Washington, the warmth has organizers of the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, a monthlong series of performances and other events, racing to meet the early flowering. Diana Mayhew, the festival\\u2019s president, said officials made the decision on Tuesday to begin five days earlier than planned, on March 15, after representatives from the Park Service briefed them on their forecast. Ms. Mayhew said she expected as many as a million and a half people to take part in the   festival, with many of them crowding the   pathways that line the Tidal Basin from dawn to well past dusk. The cherry trees date to 1912, when Japan gave some 3, 000 of them to the United States as a gesture of friendship. Only a handful of the original trees remain, but thousands more have been planted since. Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said the agency made its annual bloom prediction based on history, natural indicators on the trees and the weather forecast. The trees are considered to be in peak bloom when 70 percent of the basin\\u2019s most common variety, Yoshino, are in flower. In a typical year, that comes on April 4. But not this year. Given the mild winter and rare February warmth, the Park Service says the peak should come between March 14 and 17, depending on the weather in the coming weeks. The record, set in 1990, is March 15. Like much of the central and eastern United States, Washington has seen a winter of record and   warmth. February here was the warmest on record, with average temperatures almost 9 degrees above normal and one degree higher than a normal March. This year may be a partial anomaly, Mr. Litterst said, but the average date of peak bloom has shifted forward by almost five days since record keeping began in 1921. On Thursday, as wind cutting across the Tidal Basin tossed heavy buds through the air, a small group of blossom hunters clustered near a lone, rippling flower that they said they were happy to welcome early. Ryan Cook was delighted to be among them. On a work trip to the capital with his son, Noah, Mr. Cook had been monitoring the blossoms\\u2019 development online in hopes of catching a glimpse before leaving town. As they stopped to take a picture, though, Mr. Cook said he was a bit uneasy with a winter that even at home in Morral, Ohio, has been unusually warm  \\u2014   \\u201cscarily so. \\u201d \\u201cJust the fact that winter isn\\u2019t what it used to be  \\u2014   it just doesn\\u2019t make sense,\\u201d he said, saying it was almost certainly a sign of the changing climate that scientific studies describe. \\u201cI\\u2019ll go with the scientists. \\u201d\",\n          \"BEIRUT, Lebanon  \\u2014   On the day after his 51st birthday, Bashar   the president of Syria, took a victory lap through the dusty streets of a destroyed and empty rebel town that his forces had starved into submission. Smiling, with his shirt open at the collar, he led officials in dark suits past deserted shops and   buildings before telling a reporter that  \\u2014   despite a   announced by the United States and Russia  \\u2014   he was committed \\u201cto taking back all areas from the terrorists. \\u201d When he says terrorists, he means all who oppose him. More than five years into the conflict that has shattered his country, displaced half its population and killed hundreds of thousands of people, Mr. Assad denies any responsibility for the destruction. Instead, he presents himself as a reasonable head of state and the sole unifier who can end the war and reconcile Syria\\u2019s people. That insistence, which he has clung to for years even as his forces hit civilians with gas attacks and barrel bombs, is a major impediment to sustaining a   let alone ending the war. The new   less than a week old, is already tenuous. On Saturday, the United States acknowledged carrying out an airstrike that killed Syrian government troops in eastern Syria. Attacks have resumed across the country, and aid meant for besieged residents of Aleppo, Syria\\u2019s largest city, is still stuck at the Turkish border. Mr. Assad has become a central paradox of the war: He is secure and kept in place by foreign backers as his country splinters, although few see the war ending and Syria being put back together as long as he stays. Although he remains a pariah to the West, and scores of militant groups continue to fight to oust him, even his opponents acknowledge that he has navigated his way out of the immediate threats to his rule, making the question of his fate an intractable dilemma. The rebels are unlikely to stop fighting as long as the man they blame for the majority of the war\\u2019s deaths remains. But fear of what might emerge if Mr. Assad is ousted has deterred many Syrians from joining the insurrection and may have helped prevent countries like the United States from acting more forcefully against him. The result has been a crushing stalemate. Mr. Assad\\u2019s standing as leader of Syria is diminished  \\u2014   and yet stable. \\u201cThe problem is that he cannot win, and at the same time he is not losing,\\u201d said Samir Altaqi, the director of the Orient Research Center in Dubai. \\u201cBut at the end of the day, what is left of Syria? He is still the leader, but he lost the state. \\u201d Indeed, recent events give the impression that Mr. Assad has succeeded in muddling through, without being held accountable. August came and went with little mention of the anniversary of the chemical attacks by his forces that killed more than 1, 000 people in 2013. Turkey, a key backer of the rebels, dropped its demand that he leave power immediately, and the United States has stopped calling for his removal. And the day before Mr. Assad\\u2019s birthday on Sept. 11, for which his supporters created a fawning website, the United States and Russia announced a new   agreement with surprising benefits for Mr. Assad. Besides making no mention of his political future, the agreement brought together one of his greatest foes, the United States, with one of his greatest allies, Russia, to bomb the jihadists who threaten his rule. Years ago, few assumed that Mr. Assad would join the ranks of the world\\u2019s bloodiest dictators.   and educated as an ophthalmologist, he had not planned on a political career but was summoned from London by his father and predecessor, Hafez Assad, when the heir apparent, Bashar\\u2019s elder brother, Bassel, died in a car accident in 1994. After Bashar succeeded his father as president in 2000, many hoped he would reform the country. But those hopes dwindled, evaporating entirely with the start of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, when Mr. Assad sought to quell initially peaceful protests with overwhelming violence. The conflict escalated from there. Despite widespread opposition to his rule, a combination of factors has enabled Mr. Assad to persevere, analysts say. His foes have remained divided and have failed to convince many Syrians, especially religious minorities, that they would protect their rights or run the country better than Mr. Assad. As continuous battles have ground down his forces, Mr. Assad has been the beneficiary of significant military support from Iran, Russia and Lebanon\\u2019s Hezbollah  \\u2014   aid much more significant than what the United States and its allies have given the rebels. And the rise of jihadist organizations like the Islamic State and the   Nusra Front, recently renamed the Levant Conquest Front, have led many Syrians and some of Mr. Assad\\u2019s international opponents to conclude that he is the lesser evil. While he may be brutal to his people, the thinking goes, he does not directly threaten the West. His victory tour on Monday showcased the desolation of the town of Daraya, a longtime rebel stronghold whose remaining residents were bused out last month after an extended siege by government forces. In videos released by the Syrian government, Mr. Assad arrived in town driving his own car, a silver Hyundai fidgeted though a sermon praising him for protecting Syria and performed prayers for the Muslim Eid   holiday. Then, as martial music played, the camera jumped between images of the area\\u2019s destruction and scenes of Mr. Assad leading a determined entourage through town. A reporter stopped him for questions, and Mr. Assad spoke in soft tones about reconciliation and reconstruction. He mocked his foes as \\u201crented revolutionaries,\\u201d a dig at their foreign backing, and laughed at his turn of phrase. His entourage got the cue and laughed as well. For many Syrians, the message was clear. \\u201cHe is a man who wanted to show all Syrians that this would be their luck if they opposed him,\\u201d said Murhaf Jouejati, the chairman of the Day After organization, which aims to prepare Syrians for a democratic future. Malik Rifai, an antigovernment activist from Daraya now displaced to northern Syria, said he felt numb watching Mr. Assad walk the streets of his empty hometown, but shared a video of a flock of birds that had flown over as residents were leaving. He interpreted it as a sign that they would return, he said. \\u201cThose birds were a deep message from heaven, whereas Bashar\\u2019s presence was just a parade, showing the muscles of a weak person,\\u201d Mr. Rifai said in an online chat. Mr. Assad\\u2019s dark suits and calm tones have given him a public image more sophisticated than that of other Arab autocrats like Col. Muammar   of Libya and Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who often brandished weapons and gave thundering speeches, threatening their enemies. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a different kind of bloodthirsty dictator, the kind who shops online on his iPad,\\u201d said Nadim Houry, who oversaw the work of Human Rights Watch on Syria for a decade. \\u201cHe\\u2019s sort of Arab dictator 2. 0. \\u201d Colonel Qaddafi and Mr. Hussein were both killed after foreign interventions aimed at removing them from power  \\u2014   a fate Mr. Assad appears to have escaped, even though the death toll on his watch has exceeded that of his more colorful colleagues. His perseverance has frustrated those who feel Mr. Assad should be held accountable. \\u201cThe fact that many leaders are considering or willing to deal with him today as if he has not gassed his own people or tortured thousands to death is an indictment of the current policy environment across the world,\\u201d Mr. Houry said. \\u201cThere is a level of cynicism, a lack of ambition. \\u201d But analysts note many weaknesses in Mr. Assad\\u2019s position. After years of war, he holds less than half of Syria\\u2019s territory and his forces are depleted, making it hard for them to seize and hold new areas. Military aid from Iran and Hezbollah on the ground and from Russia in the skies has held off rebel advances, but they have also made him more dependent on foreign powers looking out for their own interests. Diplomats who track Syria say that while Iran remains committed to Mr. Assad, the Russians could negotiate him away if their interests were protected. And signs of Russian displeasure with Mr. Assad have occasionally surfaced. In June, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, visited Syria apparently without informing Mr. Assad that he was coming  \\u2014   a major embarrassment for a president who speaks often of national sovereignty. \\u201cA pleasant surprise!\\u201d a beaming Mr. Assad said in a video of the meeting. \\u201cI did not know that you were coming in person. \\u201d But Mr. Assad still has significant support in areas he controls, including among many Syrians who want the war to end and see no alternative to his rule. \\u201cIf God gives him life, I see that he\\u2019ll be president until Syria comes back the way that it was,\\u201d said Bouchra   a Lebanese lawyer who meets regularly with Syrian officials and knows Mr. Assad. She dismissed the idea that the violence of Mr. Assad\\u2019s government would make Syrians reject him after the war. \\u201cPeople love their homeland,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAll that hate and aggression will go away in the end. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
